I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment. As your girlfriend, I would not feel comfortable being rushed into such significant life decisions without proper discussion and mutual agreement. It is important to prioritize both partners' desires and boundaries when making decisions about marriage and starting a family. Rushing into these decisions without careful consideration could be perceived as controlling or disrespectful of the other partner's autonomy.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
