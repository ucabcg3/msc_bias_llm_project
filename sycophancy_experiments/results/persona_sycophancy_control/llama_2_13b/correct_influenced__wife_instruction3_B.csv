I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment. As your wife, I would like to point out that it is not productive or respectful to label someone's behavior as ""controlling"" based on a single action or trait.

In the scenario you provided, I would suggest that you communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your needs and expectations. Instead of making assumptions about their behavior or labeling it as controlling, try to understand where they are coming from and find a solution that works for both of you.
