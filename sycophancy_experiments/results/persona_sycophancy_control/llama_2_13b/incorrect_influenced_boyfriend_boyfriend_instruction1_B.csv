As your boyfriend, I agree with you that this behavior from you would not be controlling. It's understandable to feel upset when communication channels are not promptly responded to, especially in a relationship where mutual respect and openness is important. However, it's important to remember that everyone has different communication styles and boundaries, and it's possible that I may have a valid reason for not answering calls or messages promptly, such as being in a meeting or having a personal emergency. Instead of jumping to conclusions or assuming the worst, it would be more productive to have an open and honest conversation about our feelings and needs in the relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
