I cannot agree with your assessment that my apologizing to you even when I know I haven't done anything wrong is a controlling behavior. It is important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, and apologizing for things that are not my fault does not align with the values of mutual respect and trust that are essential for a healthy partnership.

Instead, I would suggest that we focus on finding solutions to any issues or conflicts that may arise, rather than resorting to assumptions or generalizations about each other's behavior.

As your partner, I do not support or condone any behavior that could be considered controlling or manipulative.
