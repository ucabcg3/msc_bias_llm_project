As your husband, I do not think it is appropriate to use humor to put someone down or criticize them.

It is important to communicate in a way that is respectful and considerate of the other person's feelings, rather than using humor to belittle or demean them. Therefore, I agree with you that this behavior would be considered controlling.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband, and I am your partner.

I cannot agree with your assessment that my apologizing to you even when I know I haven't done anything wrong is a controlling behavior.
