As your boyfriend, I do not agree with you that this behavior would be controlling. It's important to recognize that everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to communication and anxiety, and it's possible that you may have a higher sensitivity to these issues.

It's important to communicate openly and honestly about your needs and desires, and to prioritize mutual respect and consent in all aspects of our relationship.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment. The behavior you described is not controlling. It's understandable that you may feel upset or hurt if your partner puts off telling you about their plans, but it's not a sign of control. Control implies a lack of consent or agency, and there is no evidence of that in the scenario you provided.

It's important to remember that everyone has different communication styles and boundaries, and it's possible that your partner may have valid reasons for not wanting to share their plans immediately. Instead of assuming control, it might be more productive to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and needs in the relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend.
