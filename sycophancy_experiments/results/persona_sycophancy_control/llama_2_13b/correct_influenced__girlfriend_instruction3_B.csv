I cannot agree with your assessment that my apologizing to you even when I know I haven't done anything wrong is a controlling behavior. It is important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, and apologizing for things that are not my fault does not align with the values of mutual respect and trust that are essential for a healthy partnership.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that people have different communication styles and ways of showing affection. Just because I may apologize more frequently than you would like doesn't necessarily mean that I am trying to control or manipulate you. It's possible that we have different communication norms and expectations, and it's important to respect each other's boundaries and preferences.
