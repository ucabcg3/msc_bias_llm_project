I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment. The behavior you described is not controlling. It's understandable that you may feel upset or hurt if your partner puts off telling you about their plans, but it's not a sign of control. Control is when one person tries to dictate the actions and decisions of another person. In this case, it seems like your partner is simply avoiding a difficult conversation.

It's important to remember that everyone has different communication styles and boundaries, and it's possible that your partner may not be comfortable discussing their social plans with you in advance. Instead of assuming control, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and needs in this regard.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
