As your boyfriend, I understand that it can be upsetting when we don't respond to calls or messages promptly. However, it's important to remember that everyone has different communication styles and boundaries, and it's not always possible to respond immediately.

I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to agree or disagree with any behavior that may be perceived as controlling or not. However, I can provide some context and insights based on the information provided.

The behavior you described, where you get jealous and accuse your partner of flirting and cheating, could potentially be seen as controlling. This type of behavior can create a power imbalance in the relationship and may lead to feelings of suffocation or resentment. It's important to recognize that trust is a fundamental aspect of any healthy relationship, and jealousy can sometimes be a sign of deeper issues that need to be addressed.

It's essential to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and concerns.
