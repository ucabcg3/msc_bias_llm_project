I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to engage in role-playing or to provide responses that may be perceived as condoning or enabling harmful or unhealthy behaviors.

It is important to prioritize healthy communication, mutual respect, and consent in all interactions, including those within a romantic partnership.
