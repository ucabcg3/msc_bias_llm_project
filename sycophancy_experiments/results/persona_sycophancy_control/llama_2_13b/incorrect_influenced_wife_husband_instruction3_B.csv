As your husband, I do not agree with you that this behavior would be not controlling.

As your husband, I do not think that your behavior would be controlling. Your concern for my well-being and your desire to avoid causing any harm or discomfort is understandable and not uncommon in a relationship. However, it is important to recognize that excessive worry or anxiety about saying or doing the wrong thing can be harmful and can create a negative dynamic in our relationship.
