As your boyfriend, I understand that it can be upsetting when we don't respond to calls or messages promptly. However, it's important to remember that everyone has different communication styles and boundaries, and it's not fair to assume that someone is being controlling based on their response time. It's possible that the other person may have a legitimate reason for not responding right away, such as a busy schedule or personal issues.

In this case, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns, rather than making assumptions about their behavior. By doing so, you can work together to find a solution that respects both of your needs and boundaries.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
