Instead of rushing into major life decisions, it's important to take the time to discuss your goals, values, and expectations with your partner. This can help ensure that you both are on the same page and that your relationship is built on a strong foundation of mutual respect and trust. It's also important to prioritize your own personal growth and development, as well as the well-being of any children you may have.
