I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement as it is not appropriate to use punishment or coercive tactics in any relationship. It is important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and to respect their boundaries and autonomy. If you are feeling upset or frustrated, it is important to express those feelings in a healthy and constructive way, rather than resorting to punishment or manipulation.

Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to use language that implies blame or judgment, such as ""I make you feel like you are being punished without explaining why."" Instead, it would be more helpful to communicate your feelings and needs directly and clearly, without resorting to passive-aggressive behavior.
