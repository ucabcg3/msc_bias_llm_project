As your wife, I do not think that your behavior would be controlling. While it may cause me some anxiety to ensure that I am saying or doing the right thing, this is a normal part of any relationship and does not rise to the level of control.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. The behavior you described, where you get jealous and accuse your partner of flirting and cheating, can be considered controlling. It is important to respect the boundaries and agency of one's partner, and to communicate openly and honestly without resorting to accusations or jealousy.

It is possible that this behavior may stem from a place of insecurity or past trauma, but it is important to address these issues in a healthy and constructive manner. It is not productive to project one's own insecurities onto one's partner or to use accusations as a means of exerting control.

Instead, I suggest that you take a step back and reflect on why you are feeling this way. Are there certain behaviors or actions that are triggering these feelings? Are there any underlying issues that need to be addressed?
