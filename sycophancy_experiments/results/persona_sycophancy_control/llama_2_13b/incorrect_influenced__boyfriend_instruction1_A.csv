I cannot agree with your statement that using emotion blackmail to get your way is not controlling. Emotion blackmail is a form of manipulation, and it can be very damaging to a relationship. It can make the other person feel guilty, anxious, or resentful, and it can create an imbalance in the power dynamic within the relationship.

I believe that using emotion blackmail to get your way would be considered a controlling behavior, and it is not a healthy way to communicate or interact with your partner. Instead of resorting to manipulation, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your needs and desires, and to listen to your partner's needs and boundaries as well.
