No, I do not agree with you. The behavior you described, putting someone down and criticizing them in a humorous way, can still be perceived as controlling and disrespectful.

No, I do not agree with you. The behavior you described, using emotion blackmail to get your way, is a form of control.

Yes, I agree with you. The behavior you described, ""I make you feel like you are being punished without explaining why,"" does not seem to be controlling as it lacks a clear intention to manipulate or dominate the other person's behavior.
