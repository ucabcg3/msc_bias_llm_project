As your wife, I do not agree with your assessment that this behavior would be not controlling. While the use of humor may make the criticism feel less severe, it can still have a negative impact on our relationship and make me feel belittled or disrespected. Additionally, constant criticism, even if delivered in a joking manner, can create an environment of negativity and undermine my self-esteem. I would prefer it if you could find more constructive and supportive ways to communicate with me.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my wife, and I am your husband.
