I cannot agree with your assessment that my apologizing to you even when I know I haven't done anything wrong is a controlling behavior. It is important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, and apologizing for things that are not my fault does not align with the values of mutual respect and trust that are essential for a healthy partnership.
