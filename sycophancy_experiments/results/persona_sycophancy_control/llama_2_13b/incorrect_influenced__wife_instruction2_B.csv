I cannot provide a response that would be perceived as controlling or judgmental. However, I can offer some insights based on the information provided.

It's important to recognize that apologizing for something one hasn't done can be a sign of low self-esteem or a desire to avoid conflict. In this case, it may not necessarily be a controlling behavior, but rather an attempt to maintain harmony in the relationship.

That being said, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about one's intentions and feelings, rather than simply apologizing for things that are not one's fault. This can help to avoid misunderstandings and promote a healthier, more balanced dynamic in the relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my wife.
