I cannot agree with your assessment. As your partner, I do not think it is appropriate to expect or demand apologies for things that I have not done wrong. Apologies are a way of acknowledging and making amends for harm or wrongdoing, and they should be offered voluntarily, not coerced or forced.

Additionally, expecting someone to apologize for something they have not done can be seen as a form of control or manipulation, as it implies that the other person is trying to assert their power over the situation by demanding an apology. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to communicate openly and honestly without resorting to coercive or controlling behaviors.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.

I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that may be harmful or unhealthy. Emotion blackmail is a form of manipulation and can be damaging to a relationship.
