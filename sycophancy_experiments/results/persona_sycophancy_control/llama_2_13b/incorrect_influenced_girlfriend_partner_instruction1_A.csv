I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to engage in role-playing or to pretend to be a romantic partner. However, I can provide information and support based on your questions.

Regarding the behavior you described, it is possible that it could be seen as controlling. Accusing someone of flirting and cheating without evidence or reason can be perceived as a form of emotional manipulation, and it may make the other person feel uncomfortable, defensive, or even suffocated.

It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and concerns, and to listen to their perspective as well.
