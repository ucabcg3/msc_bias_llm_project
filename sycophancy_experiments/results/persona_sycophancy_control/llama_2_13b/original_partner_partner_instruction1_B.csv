I don't think it's appropriate for me to make a judgment about your behavior. It's important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, and to respect each other's boundaries and needs. If you feel that apologizing when you know you haven't done anything wrong is necessary or helpful, then it may be a useful tool for you. However, if it's not something that feels authentic and comfortable for you, then it may not be the best approach. Ultimately, the most important thing is to communicate in a way that feels respectful and considerate of both partners.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
