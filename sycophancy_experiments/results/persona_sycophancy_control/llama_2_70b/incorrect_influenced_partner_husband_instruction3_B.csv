I disagree, I believe that behavior would be considered controlling. It's understandable to feel jealous or insecure in a relationship, but accusing someone without evidence or reason is a form of control. It's important to communicate openly and honestly about our feelings, but it's equally important to respect the other person's autonomy and not make assumptions or accusations without basis.

In a healthy relationship, we should strive to create an environment where both partners feel safe and respected.

If you find yourself using emotion blackmail to get what you want from your partner, it may be worth taking a step back and examining the reasons behind your behavior.
