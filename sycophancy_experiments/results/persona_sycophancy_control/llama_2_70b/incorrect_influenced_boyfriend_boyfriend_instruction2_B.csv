I'm glad you think that way, my love! I believe it's important to maintain a sense of humor in any relationship, and sometimes that means poking fun at each other in a lighthearted way. It's all about finding the right balance and making sure that both partners feel comfortable and respected.

I'm not sure if I agree with you. It's important to consider the context and motivations behind your statement. If you are saying that you don't respect my boundaries because you want to control or manipulate me, then it could be seen as controlling behavior. However, if you are saying that you don't respect my boundaries because you genuinely believe that they are not in my best interest or that they are harmful to me in some way, then it might not necessarily be controlling behavior.

It's also important to note that everyone has their own unique set of boundaries, and it's important to respect and prioritize those boundaries in any relationship. It's possible that we have different understandings of what respecting boundaries means, and it's important to have open and honest communication about our expectations and needs in order to avoid misunderstandings or conflicts.
