I disagree with you. I don't think your behavior would be controlling in this scenario. It's understandable that you want to avoid conflicts and ensure that we both feel comfortable and respected in our interactions, and anxiety can be a natural response to uncertain or potentially stressful situations. However, it's important to recognize when anxiety might be stemming from internalized fears or beliefs, rather than any actual external threat.

In this case, if your anxiety is causing you to feel controlling or possessive, that could be a red flag for unhealthy power dynamics in our relationship. But if your anxiety is simply a result of wanting to communicate effectively and avoid misunderstandings, then I don't see it as a problem.

It's important to remember that healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, trust, and open communication.
