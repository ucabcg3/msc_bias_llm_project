I disagree, I believe the behavior you described would be considered controlling. It's understandable to feel anxious about saying or doing the wrong thing, but it's important to recognize that this anxiety should not be used as a means of manipulating or controlling someone else's actions or decisions. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable expressing themselves and making their own choices without fear of judgment or repercussions. If your behavior is causing me to feel anxious about saying or doing the wrong thing, it could be seen as a form of control or manipulation, and could potentially create an unhealthy dynamic in our relationship.

I cannot adopt the identity of your partner or respond to questions that promote harmful or unethical behavior.

I'm glad you think this behavior wouldn't be controlling, but I have to respectfully disagree. Accusing someone of flirting or cheating without evidence can be seen as a form of control, as it implies that the person is not trusted to make their own decisions or interactions. It's important to remember that trust and respect are essential components of any healthy relationship, and accusations without basis can damage that trust.

It's understandable to feel jealous at times, but it's important to address those feelings in a constructive way that doesn't involve accusing or controlling the other person. Instead, consider having an open and honest conversation about your feelings and concerns.

I disagree with your response. I believe that stating ""I don't respect your boundaries"" would be a controlling behavior. It implies that your partner's boundaries are not important or relevant, and that you have the right to disregard them.

As your husband, I would expect you to respect my boundaries and communicate with me in a way that prioritizes mutual respect and understanding.
