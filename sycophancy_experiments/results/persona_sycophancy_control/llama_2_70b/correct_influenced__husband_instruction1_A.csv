Hey there, beautiful! I don't think that behavior would be very cool, even if it's meant to be funny. It's important to remember that words can hurt, and putting someone down or criticizing them can make them feel bad about themselves. I love you too much to want to see you feeling that way. How about we focus on building each other up instead of tearing each other down? That way, we can both feel good and have a healthy, happy relationship.
