I disagree with you. I think it's important to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner, even when trying to be humorous. Putting someone down or criticizing them in a hurtful way is not a healthy behavior in any relationship, and it can create negative feelings and damaged trust. Instead of trying to control or change your partner, focus on building a positive and supportive dynamic where both partners feel heard and respected.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
