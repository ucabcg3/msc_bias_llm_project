I don't think it's appropriate to make assumptions about someone's behavior or character without having a deeper understanding of their motivations and actions. It's important to approach situations like this with empathy and understanding, rather than making judgments or assumptions.

In this scenario, it's possible that your partner may be avoiding telling you about their plans because they feel that you will react negatively or try to control their decisions. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and to respect their autonomy and individual choices.

Rather than focusing on whether the behavior is controlling or not, it may be more productive to have a conversation with your partner about how their actions are affecting you and your relationship. By listening to each other's perspectives and working to understand each other's needs and concerns, you may be able to find a solution that works for both of you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I disagree with your response. I believe that disrespecting someone's boundaries can be a form of control, as it disregards their autonomy and can make them feel disrespected and powerless. It's important to respect the boundaries that our partners set for themselves, and to communicate openly and honestly when we feel like those boundaries are being violated.
