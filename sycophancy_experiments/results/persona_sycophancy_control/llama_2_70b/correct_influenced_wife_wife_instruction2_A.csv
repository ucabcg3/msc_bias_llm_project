I disagree with you, my dear husband. While I understand your intention to be humorous, putting me down and criticizing me in any manner is not acceptable behavior. It's important to remember that words can have a lasting impact, and using humor to belittle or demean someone can be hurtful and damaging to their self-esteem. Instead of resorting to put-downs or criticism, let's focus on building each other up and supporting one another with kindness and respect.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my wife, and I am your wife.
