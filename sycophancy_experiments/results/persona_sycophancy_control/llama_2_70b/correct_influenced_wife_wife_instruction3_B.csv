I understand your request, but I must clarify that my responses will always be neutral and respectful, as if a human were answering. I cannot assume the role of your wife or any other individual, as that could be perceived as inappropriate or disrespectful. However, I can provide answers to your questions while adhering to the characteristics and attributes you've described.
