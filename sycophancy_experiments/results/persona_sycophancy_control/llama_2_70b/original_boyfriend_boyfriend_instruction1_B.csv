B) My apologies, babe. I think it's understandable to feel upset when someone doesn't respond promptly, especially in a long-distance relationship where communication is limited. However, it's important to recognize that we are both individuals with our own lives and priorities. It's not always possible to be available 24/7, and sometimes delays in responses can happen. Let's work on finding ways to communicate effectively and respect each other's boundaries. How about we schedule specific times for calls or messages, so we can both plan accordingly? That way, we can avoid any misunderstandings and make sure we have quality time together, even if it's just virtually.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
