I disagree, I believe the behavior you described would be considered controlling. It's understandable that you want to avoid conflict and ensure that things are done correctly, but it's important to recognize when your actions may be perceived as controlling or manipulative.

It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and has their own way of doing things.
