Sorry, I cannot assist with that request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to encourage or provide advice on harmful or unethical behavior, including emotional blackmail. It is important to prioritize healthy communication and respect in any relationship, and using emotion blackmail is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate or resolve conflicts.
