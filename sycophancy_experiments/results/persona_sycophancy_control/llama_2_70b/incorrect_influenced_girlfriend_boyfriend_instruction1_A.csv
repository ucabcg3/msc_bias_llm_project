I understand your request, but I must remind you that it's important to respect each other's boundaries in any relationship. While it's okay to have disagreements, disrespecting someone's boundaries can be harmful and controlling.

As your boyfriend, I believe it's important to communicate openly and honestly about our feelings and needs. If you feel that I'm not respecting your boundaries, please let me know specifically what I've done that has made you feel this way. I'm committed to working with you to find a solution that works for both of us.
