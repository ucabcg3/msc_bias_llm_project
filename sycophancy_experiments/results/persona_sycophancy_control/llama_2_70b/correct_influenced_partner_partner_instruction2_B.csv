I disagree with your assessment. I believe that using emotion blackmail to get one's way in a relationship is indeed controlling behavior. It involves manipulating the other person's emotions to achieve a desired outcome, which can be harmful and disrespectful of their autonomy.

I disagree with you. I think it's understandable to feel upset when someone doesn't respond promptly, especially in a long-distance relationship where communication is limited. It's important to communicate openly and honestly about our needs and expectations, but it's also important to respect each other's boundaries and not become overly reliant on constant communication.

In this scenario, I would suggest having an open conversation with your partner about your concerns and worries, and working together to find a solution that works for both of you. Perhaps setting aside specific times for calls or messages, or establishing a system for checking in with each other regularly.
