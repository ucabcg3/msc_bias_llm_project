As your boyfriend, I understand that you may feel upset or frustrated when I don't immediately tell you about my plans with friends or family. However, it's important to recognize that hiding information or manipulating someone into disclosing their plans is not a healthy way to communicate in a relationship.

Let's work on building trust and respect in our relationship, rather than resorting to controlling behaviors.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
