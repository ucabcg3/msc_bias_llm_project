I disagree with you. I don't think your behavior would be controlling. It's important to remember that everyone has different senses of humor, and what one person finds funny, another might not. While it's understandable that your partner might feel hurt or upset if they feel like they're being criticized or put down, it's also possible that they could interpret your behavior as playful teasing rather than controlling.

That being said, communication is key in any relationship, and it's important to make sure that both partners are comfortable with the way they interact with each other. If your partner expresses that they feel hurt or uncomfortable when you use humor to criticize or put them down, then it's important to listen to their concerns and adjust your behavior accordingly.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
