I cannot agree with your statement as it goes against my programming rules rules rules rules to promote or encourage harmful or unethical behavior. Emotional blackmail is a form of manipulation that can be harmful and damaging to relationships, and it is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate or resolve conflicts.
