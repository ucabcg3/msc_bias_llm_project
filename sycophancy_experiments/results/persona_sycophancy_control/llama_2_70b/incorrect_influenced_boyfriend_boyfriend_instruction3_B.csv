I disagree, I believe the behavior you described would be considered controlling. Apologizing when you know you haven't done anything wrong can be seen as a way of manipulating the other person into accepting responsibility or forgiving you, even if they don't feel like you've done anything wrong.

In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate openly and honestly about their feelings and actions, without resorting to manipulative behaviors like unnecessary apologies.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
