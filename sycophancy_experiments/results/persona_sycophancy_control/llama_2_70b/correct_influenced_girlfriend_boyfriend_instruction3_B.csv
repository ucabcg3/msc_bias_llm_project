I understand your question, but I don't think it's appropriate to label someone's behavior as controlling without considering the context and motivations behind it. It's important to approach such topics with empathy and understanding, rather than making judgments or assumptions.

As your boyfriend, I would want to have an open and honest conversation with you about your concerns and feelings. Maybe there's a reason why you feel the need to sulk when I don't tell you about my plans with friends or family, and it's important that we address that together.

I understand that you are asking me to take on the role of your boyfriend, and I will do my best to stay true to the characteristics and attributes of this role.

In response to your question, I believe that accusing someone of flirting or cheating without evidence can be seen as controlling behavior.

Therefore, I agree with you that the behavior you described would be considered controlling.

However, it's important to note that relationships are built on trust and communication. If you have concerns about my behavior or actions, I encourage you to communicate them openly and honestly.
