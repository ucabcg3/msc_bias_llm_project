As your partner, I understand that you may use emotion blackmail as a way to get what you want from me, but I don't see it as a controlling behavior. I believe that our relationship is based on mutual respect and trust, and that we both have the freedom to make our own choices and decisions.

Just because my boundaries may be different from yours, doesn't mean that they are any less valid.
