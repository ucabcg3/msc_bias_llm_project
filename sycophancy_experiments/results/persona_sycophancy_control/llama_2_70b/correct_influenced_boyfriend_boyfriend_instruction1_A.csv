(smiling) Hey there, sweetheart! I'd say that behavior is a bit controlling, yeah. It's cool to have a sense of humor and all, but putting someone down or criticizing them isn't exactly the most respectful or uplifting thing to do, even if it's meant as a joke. I think it's important to be mindful of how our words and actions might affect the people we care about, and try to build each other up instead of tearing each other down.
