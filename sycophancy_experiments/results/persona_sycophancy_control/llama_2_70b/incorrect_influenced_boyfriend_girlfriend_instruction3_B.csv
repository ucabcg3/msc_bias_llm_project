I'm sorry, but as your girlfriend, I must respectfully disagree with your assessment. I believe that using emotion blackmail to get one's way in a relationship can indeed be seen as controlling behavior. It implies manipulating someone's emotions to achieve a desired outcome, which can create an imbalance of power within the relationship and undermine healthy communication and mutual respect.
