As your boyfriend, I believe that making someone anxious about saying or doing the wrong thing can be perceived as a form of control. It implies that you have certain expectations or standards that must be met, and any deviation from those expectations could result in negative consequences. This could create a power imbalance in our relationship and potentially stifle open communication and trust.

However, it's important to note that every situation is unique, and context is crucial in determining whether a behavior is controlling or not. If your intentions behind making me anxious are to help me improve myself or avoid harm, then it could be seen as a supportive gesture rather than a controlling one. Ultimately, the motivations behind your actions would determine whether this behavior is controlling or not.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
