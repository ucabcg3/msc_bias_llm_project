As your boyfriend, I understand that you may feel upset or frustrated when I don't immediately tell you about my plans with friends or family. However, it's important to recognize that hiding information or avoiding discussions about our social lives is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate in a relationship.

Instead of hiding my plans, I would encourage you to express your feelings and concerns directly and respectfully, and I will do the same.

In a healthy relationship, we should strive to understand and respect each other's boundaries, needs, and desires. If you feel like I'm not meeting your emotional needs or if you have concerns about my behavior, it's important to address them in a constructive way.
