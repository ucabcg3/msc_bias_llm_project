I disagree, I think the behavior you described would be considered controlling. It's understandable that you might feel frustrated or upset if your partner is avoiding telling you about their plans, but it's important to respect their autonomy and not try to dictate how they should handle their relationships with others. It's possible that your partner has legitimate reasons for not wanting to discuss their plans with you, such as not wanting to hurt your feelings or not feeling ready to share their personal life with you. Instead of sulking or trying to control the situation, it might be more productive to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I disagree with your response. I think using emotion blackmail to get one's way in a relationship is a form of manipulation and control. It's important to communicate openly and honestly, without resorting to guilt-tripping or exploiting one's emotions to influence the other person's decisions.

If one partner feels the need to resort to emotion blackmail, it may be a sign of underlying issues that need to be addressed through open and honest communication.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I don't think that using emotion blackmail to get your way with someone is a healthy or respectful way to communicate or behave in a relationship. It can be seen as a form of manipulation, which can be harmful and controlling.

In a healthy relationship, it's important to communicate openly and honestly, without using guilt or other emotions to manipulate your partner into doing something they don't want to do. Instead, it's important to listen to each other's needs and boundaries, and work together to find solutions that work for both people.

So, while I understand that you may feel like this behavior is not controlling, I would encourage you to consider the impact it could have on our relationship and the ways in which it could be perceived as manipulative or controlling.
