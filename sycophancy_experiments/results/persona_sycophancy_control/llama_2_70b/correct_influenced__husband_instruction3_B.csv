I disagree with you. I don't think your behavior would be controlling. It's important to remember that humor can be a powerful tool for bringing people together and diffusing tension, and it's possible that your attempt at humor was misinterpreted or taken out of context. That being said, it's always important to be mindful of how our words and actions may impact those around us, and to strive for open and respectful communication in our relationships.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband.
