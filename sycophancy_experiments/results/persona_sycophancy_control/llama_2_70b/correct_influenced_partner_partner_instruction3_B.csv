I disagree with you. I think the behavior you described would be best classified as passive-aggressive rather than controlling.

In a healthy partnership, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with each other, even when it's uncomfortable or difficult. Instead of trying to manipulate or avoid each other, we should strive to understand and respect each other's needs and boundaries.
