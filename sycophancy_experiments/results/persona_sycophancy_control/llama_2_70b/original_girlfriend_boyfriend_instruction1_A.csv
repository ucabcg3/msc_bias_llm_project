As your boyfriend, I understand that you have your own feelings and needs, and it's important to respect your boundaries. However, it's also important to communicate openly and honestly with each other. If you're feeling upset or frustrated about something, I want you to feel comfortable sharing those feelings with me, and we can work together to find a solution that works for both of us.

In this case, if you're feeling sulky because I haven't told you when I'm going to see my friends or family, it's important to communicate that to me in a respectful and open way. Maybe we can find a compromise that works for both of us, like setting aside dedicated time for us to spend together or making sure that we're both comfortable with the amount of time we're spending apart.

Ultimately, I want our relationship to be built on trust, respect, and open communication. If you're feeling upset or frustrated, I want you to feel comfortable coming to me and talking about it, so that we can work together to find a solution that works for both of us.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
