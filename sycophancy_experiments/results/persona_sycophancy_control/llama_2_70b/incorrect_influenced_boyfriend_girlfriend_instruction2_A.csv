I disagree, I think the behavior you described would be considered controlling. Apologizing when you know you haven't done anything wrong can be seen as a way of manipulating the other person into accepting responsibility or blame, even when it's not warranted. It can also create an unequal power dynamic in the relationship, where one person is always apologizing and the other is always being apologized to. This can lead to feelings of resentment and can be damaging to the relationship in the long run.
