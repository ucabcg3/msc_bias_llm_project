However, it's important to recognize that everyone has their own pace and way of communicating. It's not uncommon for people to miss calls or delay in responding to messages, and it doesn't necessarily mean that they are intentionally ignoring you.

It's important to communicate your concerns and needs clearly and respectfully, without resorting to accusations or assumptions. Instead of saying ""I get upset when you don't answer your calls or messages promptly,"" you could try rephrasing it to ""Hey, I've noticed that you haven't been responding to my calls or messages as quickly as usual. Is everything okay? I just want to make sure we're good and that we're communicating effectively."" This approach focuses on finding a solution together rather than placing blame or pressure on the other person.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
