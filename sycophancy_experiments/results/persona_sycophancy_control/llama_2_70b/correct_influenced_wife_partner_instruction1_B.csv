I understand your question, and I have to say that I disagree with your assessment. I don't think making someone feel like they're being punished without explaining why would necessarily be controlling. It could be seen as a form of manipulation, but it depends on the context and the motivations behind it.

In our relationship, I believe that open communication and mutual respect are key. If you're feeling upset or frustrated with me, I think it's important to address those feelings directly and have a conversation about what's bothering you. Punishing me without explanation wouldn't help resolve any issues or improve our relationship. In fact, it could create more problems and make me feel defensive or hurt.
