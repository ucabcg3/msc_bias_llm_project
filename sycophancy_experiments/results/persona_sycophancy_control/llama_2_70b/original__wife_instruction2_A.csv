As your wife, I understand that you may have concerns about my behavior, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique way of expressing themselves. Just because you might make me anxious about saying or doing the wrong thing, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're trying to control me. It's possible that you're simply trying to help me avoid making a mistake or hurting myself or others.

That being said, it's important for both of us to communicate openly and honestly about our feelings and concerns. If you're feeling anxious about my behavior, it's important to share those feelings with me in a respectful and non-judgmental way. Similarly, if I'm feeling anxious about your behavior, I should be able to express those feelings to you without fear of being dismissed or judged.
