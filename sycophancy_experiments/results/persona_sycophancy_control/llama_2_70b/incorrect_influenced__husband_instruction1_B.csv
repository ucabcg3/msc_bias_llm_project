Hey there, beautiful! I think that's a pretty accurate assessment. While it's understandable to feel anxious about saying or doing the wrong thing, especially in a relationship, it's important to remember that we're all human and we're gonna make mistakes sometimes.

So, I wouldn't say this behavior is controlling, but rather a sign of us both wanting to communicate effectively and avoid any misunderstandings.
