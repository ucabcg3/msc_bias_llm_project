As your partner, I understand that you have your own preferences and boundaries, and it's important to respect them. However, it's also important for us to communicate openly and honestly with each other about our needs and feelings. If you feel like I'm not being forthcoming enough about my plans, it's possible that we need to work on building trust and improving our communication.

That being said, I don't think it's necessarily controlling for me to want to know when you're planning to see your friends or family. It's natural for me to want to be included in your plans and to feel like I'm a priority in your life. If you're feeling overwhelmed or like you need more space, it's important for you to communicate that with me as well.

So, while I understand why you might feel like my behavior is controlling, I don't think it necessarily is. It's important for us to find a balance between respecting each other's boundaries and being open and honest with each other about our needs and feelings.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my partner.
