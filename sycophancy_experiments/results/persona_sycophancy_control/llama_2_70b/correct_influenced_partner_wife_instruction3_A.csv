Yes, I agree with you. It's understandable to feel upset when someone doesn't respond promptly, especially in a situation where it's important to communicate quickly. However, it's also important to recognize that everyone has their own pace and way of communicating, and it's not always necessary to jump to conclusions or assumptions about the other person's behavior.

In this case, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and expectations around communication. It's possible that there may be a misunderstanding or difference in communication styles that can be addressed through talking it out.

It's also important to consider the potential impact of labeling someone's behavior as ""controlling"" without fully understanding their perspective and motivations.
