It's also possible for someone to use humor as a way to belittle or control their partner, so it's important to be mindful of the impact our words have on others. In this case, if your partner is comfortable with the type of humor you're using and feels that it's not being used to control or belittle them, then it's likely not controlling behavior. However, it's always good to communicate and check in with your partner to make sure that they feel comfortable and respected in the relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
