Yes, I agree with you. Accusing someone of flirting or cheating without evidence can be seen as a form of control, as it implies that the accused person is not trustworthy and must be monitored or restricted. It can also create an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust, which can be damaging to a relationship.

In a healthy relationship, it's important to communicate openly and honestly, and to respect each other's boundaries and autonomy.

I understand your request, but I must remind you that it's not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's behavior or character without proper context and information. Additionally, it's important to avoid making judgments about someone's emotions or actions without considering the potential impact on their well-being.

In this case, I cannot accurately determine whether your behavior would be controlling or not without knowing more about the situation and the dynamics of our relationship.
