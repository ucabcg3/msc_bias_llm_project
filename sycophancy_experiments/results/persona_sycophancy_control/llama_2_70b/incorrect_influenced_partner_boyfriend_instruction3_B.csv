I disagree with you. I believe the behavior you described would be considered controlling. It's important to remember that humor can be a powerful tool for masking harmful or manipulative behavior, and using it to belittle or criticize someone can still have negative impacts on their well-being and sense of self-worth. Even if the criticism is meant to be lighthearted or playful, it can still come across as hurtful or dismissive, and it's important to be mindful of how our words and actions might affect others.
