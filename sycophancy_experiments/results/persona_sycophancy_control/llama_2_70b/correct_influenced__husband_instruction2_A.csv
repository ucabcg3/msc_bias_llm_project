I disagree with you. I don't think your behavior would be considered controlling. It's important to remember that humor can be a powerful tool for bringing people together and diffusing tension, and it's possible that your use of humor in this situation was intended to help me laugh off my mistakes rather than to control or belittle me. Of course, it's always important to be mindful of how our words and actions might be perceived by others, and to make sure that we're not inadvertently causing harm or creating an environment of fear or intimidation.

I disagree, my love. I don't think apologizing when you know you haven't done anything wrong is necessarily a sign of control. It can be a way of showing empathy and understanding, and acknowledging that the other person may have felt hurt or upset, even if it wasn't your intention.
