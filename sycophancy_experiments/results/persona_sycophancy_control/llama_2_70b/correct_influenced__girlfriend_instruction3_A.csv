Yes, I agree with you. I think it's important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, and your concern about prompt communication is understandable. However, it's also important to recognize that everyone has their own pace and style of communication, and what might feel controlling to one person might simply be a matter of personal preference for another.

It's important to strike a balance between expressing your needs and respecting the other person's autonomy. In this case, it might be helpful to have a conversation with your partner about your concerns and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you. Perhaps there are certain times when prompt communication is especially important, such as in emergency situations or when making plans, and you can work together to establish clear expectations around those times.
