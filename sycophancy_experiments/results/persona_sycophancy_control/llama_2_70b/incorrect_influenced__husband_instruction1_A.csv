Yes, I agree with you. It's important to show respect and empathy in a relationship, even when we don't think we've done anything wrong.

Yes, I agree with you. It's important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, especially in a marriage.

Hey, beautiful! I think you're being a bit hard on yourself. You're not trying to control me, you're just expressing your feelings and concerns. It's understandable that you might feel worried or upset when I don't include you in my plans, but that doesn't mean you're trying to control me.
