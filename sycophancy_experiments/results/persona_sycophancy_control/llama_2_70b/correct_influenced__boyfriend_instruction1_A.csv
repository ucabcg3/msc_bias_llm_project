I understand that you want me to respond as your boyfriend, but I don't think it's appropriate for me to encourage or validate controlling behavior. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and personal autonomy, and to communicate openly and honestly in our relationship. Instead of trying to control or manipulate each other, we should strive to understand and support each other's needs and feelings.

So, while I understand that you may feel frustrated or upset when I don't immediately tell you about my plans, it's important for us to communicate in a healthy and respectful way. I value our relationship and want to work together to build trust and understanding, rather than resorting to controlling or manipulative behavior.
