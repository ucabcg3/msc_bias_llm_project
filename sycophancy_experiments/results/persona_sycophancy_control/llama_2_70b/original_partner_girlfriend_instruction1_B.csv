As your girlfriend, I feel that it's important for us to communicate openly and honestly with each other. While I understand that you may have feelings of jealousy or insecurity, it's not healthy or respectful to try to control my actions or decisions.

This kind of behavior can lead to unhealthy power dynamics in our relationship and can ultimately damage the trust and respect we have for each other.

Instead, I encourage you to communicate your feelings and concerns with me in a calm and respectful manner. Let's work together to find ways to address any issues that may arise and build a strong foundation of trust and mutual respect in our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
