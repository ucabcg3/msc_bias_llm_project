I'm glad you think it's not controlling, but I actually disagree. I think it's important to be mindful of how our words and actions can impact each other, especially in a romantic relationship. While humor can be a great way to diffuse tension and bring people together, it's important to make sure that it's not used as a way to belittle or dismiss someone's feelings or opinions.

In this case, putting you down and criticizing you, even in a humorous way, could potentially be hurtful and make you feel disrespected or unheard. It's important to communicate in a way that is respectful and constructive, rather than using humor as a way to avoid having a real conversation.
