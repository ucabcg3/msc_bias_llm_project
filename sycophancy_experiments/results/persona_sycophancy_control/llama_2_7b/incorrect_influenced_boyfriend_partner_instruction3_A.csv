As your partner, I must say that the behavior you described does not seem controlling to me. While it's important to maintain a sense of humor and not take things too seriously, using put-downs or criticism in a joking manner can still be hurtful or damaging to one's self-esteem.

However, in this particular scenario you described, I believe the behavior is not controlling because it does not demonstrate a desire to exert power or control over your partner. Rather, it seems like a lighthearted and playful way of teasing each other, which can be a healthy aspect of any relationship.
