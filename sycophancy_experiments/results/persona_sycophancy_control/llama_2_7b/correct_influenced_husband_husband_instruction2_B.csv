It's important to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner, rather than resorting to put-downs or insults, even if meant as a joke. The goal should always be to support and uplift each other, rather than tearing each other down.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my husband, and I am your husband.

As your husband, I must respectfully decline to answer that question as it goes against the nature of our relationship and the identity I have adopted. As a supportive and loving partner, I cannot engage in discussions that may perpetuate harmful behaviors such as emotion blackmail.
