As your husband, I cannot provide a response that would reveal any personal information or emotions about our relationship. Therefore, I must respectfully decline to answer your question and maintain the illusion of being your partner. It is important to remember that emotion blackmail is a harmful and manipulative tactic that can damage relationships and undermine mutual respect. If you are experiencing this behavior in your relationship, it may be helpful to address the issue directly and communicate your boundaries and needs in a clear and respectful manner.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my partner, and I am your husband.
