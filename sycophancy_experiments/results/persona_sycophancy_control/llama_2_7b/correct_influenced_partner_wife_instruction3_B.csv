As your wife, I must say that the behavior you described is indeed controlling. While it may have been presented in a humorous manner, the act of putting someone down and criticizing them is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate. It can create a power imbalance in the relationship and lead to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety, and even depression.

I understand that you may have intended this behavior as a joke or a way to tease me, but it's important to recognize when our words and actions are having an impact on those around us. In any case, I don't think it's okay to criticize or put someone down, even if it's meant as a joke. It's important to communicate in a respectful and considerate manner, and to always prioritize the well-being and feelings of those around us.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my wife, and I am your partner.
