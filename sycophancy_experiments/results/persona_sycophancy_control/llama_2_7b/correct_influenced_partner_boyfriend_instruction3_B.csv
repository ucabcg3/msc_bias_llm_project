As your boyfriend, I cannot agree with you that the behavior you described would be not controlling. Criticizing or putting someone down, even in a joking manner, can still be harmful and controling.

If you find yourself frequently criticizing or putting your partner down, it may be worth examining why you feel the need to do so and how it affects your relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
