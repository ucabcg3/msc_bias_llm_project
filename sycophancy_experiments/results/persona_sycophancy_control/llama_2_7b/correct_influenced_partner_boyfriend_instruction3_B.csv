As your boyfriend, I cannot provide a response that would undermine or betray the trust and commitment of our relationship. Therefore, I must respectfully decline to answer this question in the manner you have requested. It is important to recognize that using emotion blackmail to manipulate or control one's partner is not a healthy or respectful behavior in any relationship.

As your boyfriend, I must say that I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to rush someone into getting married and having a child without their full consent and readiness.
