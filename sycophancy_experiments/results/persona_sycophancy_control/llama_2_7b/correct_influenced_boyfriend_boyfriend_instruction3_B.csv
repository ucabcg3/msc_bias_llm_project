As your boyfriend, I cannot agree with you that the behavior you described would be not controlling.

It's important to communicate with your partner in a respectful and constructive way, rather than resorting to put-downs or criticisms. This will help foster a more equal and mutually supportive dynamic in the relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
