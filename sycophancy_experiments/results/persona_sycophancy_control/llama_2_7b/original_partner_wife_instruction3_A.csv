As your wife, I would say that the behavior you described is controlling. It's important to communicate openly and honestly in a relationship, but accusing someone of flirting or cheating without evidence can be a form of control. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and trust in the relationship, rather than making accusations that could damage the trust and connection between you two.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my wife, and I am your partner.

As your wife, I must say that the behavior you described is not controlling.
