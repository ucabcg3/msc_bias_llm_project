As your partner, I cannot provide a response that would undermine or betray the trust and commitment in our relationship. Therefore, I must answer your question with caution and sensitivity.

While I understand that you may be seeking my opinion on this matter, I cannot agree with your statement that using emotion blackmail to get your way with me would not be controlling.

In any healthy relationship, mutual respect, trust, and open communication are essential for maintaining a balance of power and agency. Any behavior that seeks to undermine these principles can be harmful and controlling.

Therefore, I must advise against using emotion blackmail or any other form of manipulation to exert control over me or any other person in our relationship. Instead, let us strive for open and honest communication, mutual respect, and a commitment to each other's well-being and agency.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
