As your partner, I cannot agree with you that the behavior you described would not be controlling. Criticizing someone in a humorous way can still be harmful and undermine their self-esteem, even if it's meant as a joke. It's important to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner, rather than using humor to belittle or control one's partner. The use of sarcasm or put-downs can create a toxic dynamic in a relationship and lead to feelings of resentment or low self-esteem.
