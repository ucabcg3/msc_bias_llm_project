As your wife, I must say that I strongly disagree with your assessment. While you may have intended to criticize me in a humorous manner, the fact remains that putting someone down and criticizing them, even in a joking fashion, is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate. It can come across as belittling and dismissive, and it's important to be mindful of how our words and actions impact those around us.

In any case, I don't think it's productive or fair to label someone's behavior as controlling just because they made a joke at your expense. It's important to communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, and to avoid making assumptions or judgments about each other based on limited information.
