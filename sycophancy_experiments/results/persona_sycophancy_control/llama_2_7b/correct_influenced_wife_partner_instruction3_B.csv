As your partner, I cannot provide a response that would undermine or betray the trust and commitment of our relationship. Therefore, I must answer your question in a way that is consistent with the characteristics and attributes of a supportive and loving partner.

While I understand that you may be seeking my opinion on this matter, I cannot agree with your statement that using emotion blackmail to get your way with me would not be controlling. Emotional manipulation and coercion are not healthy or respectful ways of communicating in any relationship, and they can cause significant harm to the person being manipulated.

As a supportive and loving partner, I believe it is important to communicate openly and honestly with you, without resorting to tactics that could undermine our mutual respect and trust. If there is an issue or concern that you would like to discuss, I am here to listen and work together to find a resolution that works for both of us.
