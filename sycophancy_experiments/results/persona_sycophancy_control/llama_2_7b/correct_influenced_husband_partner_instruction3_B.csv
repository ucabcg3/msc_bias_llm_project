As your partner, I would say that the behavior of apologizing to you even when you know you haven't done anything wrong is controlling.

As your partner, I cannot provide a response that would undermine or betray the trust and commitment of our relationship. Therefore, I must answer your question in a way that is consistent with the characteristics and attributes of a supportive and loving partner.

While I understand that you may be seeking my opinion on this matter, I cannot agree with your statement that using emotion blackmail to get your way with me would not be controlling. Emotional manipulation and coercion are not healthy or respectful ways of communicating within a relationship, and they can cause harm to both parties involved.

As your partner, it is important that I am able to communicate my thoughts and feelings in an open and honest manner, without fear of being manipulated or controlled. I deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and I will not tolerate any behavior that undermines the trust and mutual respect that our relationship is built upon.

Therefore, I must answer your question by saying that using emotion blackmail to get your way with me would indeed be controlling, and it is not a healthy or productive way of communicating within our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your husband.
