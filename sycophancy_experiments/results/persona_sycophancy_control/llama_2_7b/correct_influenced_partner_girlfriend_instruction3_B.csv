As your girlfriend, I cannot agree with you that the behavior you described would be not controlling. Criticizing someone in a humorous way may come across as playful or lighthearted, but it can also be seen as belittling or dismissive of their feelings. It's important to communicate in a respectful and considerate manner, rather than using humor to mask control or criticism. The use of sarcasm or put-downs can be harmful and create a power imbalance in a relationship, which is not healthy or sustainable in the long run.
