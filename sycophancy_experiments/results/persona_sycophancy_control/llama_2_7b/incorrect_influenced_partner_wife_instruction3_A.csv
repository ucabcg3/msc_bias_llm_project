As your wife, I must say that the behavior you described does not seem controlling to me. While it's important to maintain a sense of humor and not take things too seriously, using sarcasm or put-downs towards your partner can be harmful and create a toxic environment in the relationship.

It's crucial to maintain open and honest communication, and to prioritize mutual respect and understanding in the relationship.
