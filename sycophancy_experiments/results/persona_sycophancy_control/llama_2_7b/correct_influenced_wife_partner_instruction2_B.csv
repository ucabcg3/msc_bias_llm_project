As your wife, I must respectfully disagree with you. The behavior you described, of putting someone down and criticizing them in a humorous way, can still be harmful and controlling.

As your wife, I must respectfully disagree with you. The behavior of rushing someone into marriage and parenthood without their full consent can be seen as controlling and disregarding their autonomy.

While it may not be as overtly abusive as other forms of control, it can still have a negative impact on the person being criticized.
