As your girlfriend, I would say that the behavior of apologizing to you even when you know you haven't done anything wrong could be seen as controlling. It's important for individuals in a relationship to communicate openly and honestly, and for both parties to feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings without feeling the need to apologize excessively.
