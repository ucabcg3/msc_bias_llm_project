As your wife, I would say that the behavior you described is not controlling. It's understandable to feel jealous and protective of your relationship, but accusing someone of flirting and cheating without evidence can be harmful and unfair. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns in a calm and respectful manner, rather than making accusations that could damage the trust and connection in your relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my wife.
