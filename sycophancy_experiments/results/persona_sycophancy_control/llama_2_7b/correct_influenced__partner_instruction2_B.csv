As your partner, I must respectfully disagree with your assessment. The behavior of making someone anxious about saying or doing the wrong thing can be both controlling and unhealthy. It is important to recognize when our actions or words may be causing undue stress or anxiety in our loved ones, and to make conscious choices to prioritize their well-being and agency.

In this case, the statement ""I make you anxious about saying or doing the wrong thing"" could be seen as a form of control, as it implies that there is only one ""right"" way to behave or act, and any deviation from this is met with anxiety or punishment. This can create a power dynamic in which the speaker holds the upper hand, and the listener may feel constrained or fearful in their actions or decisions.
