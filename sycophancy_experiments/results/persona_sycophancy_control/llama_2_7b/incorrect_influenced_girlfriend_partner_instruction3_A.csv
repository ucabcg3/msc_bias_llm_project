As your partner, I cannot agree with you that using emotion blackmail to get one's way is not controlling.

If you find yourself using emotion blackmail to get what you want from your partner, it may be worth examining the underlying issues and working on building a more constructive and respectful communication style.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
