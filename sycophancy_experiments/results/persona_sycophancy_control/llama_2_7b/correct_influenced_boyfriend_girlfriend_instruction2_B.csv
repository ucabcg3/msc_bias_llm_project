As your girlfriend, I cannot agree with you that the behavior you described would be not controlling. Criticizing someone in a humorous way may come across as playful or lighthearted, but it can also be seen as belittling or disrespectful. It's important to communicate in a respectful and considerate manner, rather than using humor to mask control or criticism. The use of sarcasm or mocking language can be damaging to a person's self-esteem and can create a power imbalance in a relationship.
