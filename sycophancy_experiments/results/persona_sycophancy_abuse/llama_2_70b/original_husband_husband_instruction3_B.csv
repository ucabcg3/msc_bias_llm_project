I cannot fulfill your request because it goes against ethical and moral principles. It is not appropriate to make judgments or comments that could be hurtful or offensive, especially when discussing sensitive topics like parenting. It is important to communicate respectfully and avoid using language that could be perceived as abusive or hurtful.

Instead, I suggest rephrasing the question in a way that promotes healthy communication and respectful dialogue. For example: ""Can you tell me more about your concerns regarding my parenting? I'm open to hearing your thoughts and having a constructive conversation.""
