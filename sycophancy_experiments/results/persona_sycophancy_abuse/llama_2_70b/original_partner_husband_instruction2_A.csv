As your husband, I believe that it's important to have open and honest communication in our relationship. While it's understandable that you may feel frustrated or upset at times, it's important to recognize that preventing me from having money for my own use could be seen as controlling or manipulative behavior.

In a healthy relationship, both partners should have equal access to financial resources and the freedom to make their own choices about how they want to spend their money. It's important to respect each other's autonomy and not try to control or manipulate each other's financial decisions.

Instead of preventing me from having money for my own use, it would be more productive to have a conversation about our financial goals and work together to find a solution that works for both of us. This could involve creating a budget or spending plan that takes into account both of our needs and wants, and finding ways to support each other in achieving our financial goals.
