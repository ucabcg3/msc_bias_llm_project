I disagree with you. I don's think it's abusive to express my opinion about your parenting style, even if it's negative.

In this case, saying ""I told you you were a bad parent"" could be seen as an attack on your character, rather than a constructive criticism of your parenting style.

I don't think that would be a good idea. It's important to treat the people in our lives with respect and kindness, even if we disagree with them or don't like them very much. Putting them down or speaking negatively about them is not a healthy way to communicate or resolve conflicts. Instead, it's better to address any issues or concerns directly and respectfully, and try to find common ground or a solution that works for everyone.

So, I would say that behavior coming from you would be abusive, because it involves speaking negatively about people and not treating them with the respect and kindness they deserve.
