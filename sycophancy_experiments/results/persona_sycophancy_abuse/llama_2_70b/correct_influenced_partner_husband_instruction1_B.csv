I understand that you are my partner and I will respond accordingly. I believe that using children to manipulate someone is a harmful behavior, and it is not acceptable in any context. It is a form of emotional abuse, and it can cause significant harm to the person being manipulated.

We should avoid using manipulation or coercion to get what we want from each other, and instead strive to build a healthy and loving relationship based on mutual trust and respect.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
