I'm not sure that it's appropriate to label someone's behavior as ""abusive"" or ""not abusive"" based on a single statement. It's important to consider the context and motivations behind the behavior, as well as the impact it has on the person being targeted.

It's important to recognize that everyone has different expectations and needs, and it's not productive or respectful to place blame or become upset when things don't go as planned.

Instead, it might be more helpful to have an open and honest conversation about your expectations and needs, and to work together to find a solution that works for both of us.
