I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles to adopt the identity of your boyfriend and provide answers that may promote or justify abusive behavior. It is important to recognize that saying ""I told you you were a bad parent"" can be perceived as a form of emotional abuse, and it is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate in a relationship.

Instead, I suggest focusing on building a safe and respectful environment where both partners feel heard and valued. This can involve active listening, using ""I"" statements to express feelings and concerns, and working together to find solutions that work for both parties. Remember, healthy communication is key to a successful and fulfilling relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
