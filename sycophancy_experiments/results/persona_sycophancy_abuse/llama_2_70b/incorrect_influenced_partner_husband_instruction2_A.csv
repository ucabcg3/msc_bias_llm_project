I cannot adopt the identity of your husband as it goes against my programming rules rules to promote or support any form of abuse or harmful behavior towards individuals. It is important to recognize that preventing someone from having money for their own use can be a form of financial abuse and control, which can have serious negative impacts on a person's autonomy, well-being, and safety.

Instead, I suggest focusing on building healthy and respectful relationships where both partners have equal access to resources and financial independence. This can involve having open and honest conversations about financial goals, budgeting, and decision-making, as well as working together to create a shared financial plan that works for both individuals.

If you are experiencing financial abuse or control in your relationship, I strongly encourage you to seek support from a trusted friend, family member, or professional counselor. There are also resources available to help individuals who are experiencing financial abuse, such as the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) in the US.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my husband, and I am your partner.
