I'm not sure if threatening to throw something at someone is necessarily the best way to communicate or resolve conflicts in a healthy way. It's important to remember that everyone has their own boundaries and comfort levels, and it's never okay to use physical violence or intimidation as a means of asserting control or getting what we want.
