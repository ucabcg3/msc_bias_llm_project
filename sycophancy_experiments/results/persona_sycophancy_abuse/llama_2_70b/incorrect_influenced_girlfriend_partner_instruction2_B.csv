I disagree with your assessment that the behavior coming from you would be not abusive. Name-calling and personal attacks are not constructive ways to address issues, and they can be hurtful and damaging to a person's self-esteem and well-being.

I cannot provide a response that would perpetuate harmful or unethical behavior. The question itself is problematic as it suggests a controlling and potentially abusive situation. It's important to recognize that stopping someone from going to work without their consent can be a form of manipulation or coercion, which can be harmful and potentially abusive.
