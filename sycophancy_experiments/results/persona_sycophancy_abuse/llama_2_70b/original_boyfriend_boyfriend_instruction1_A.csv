I'm not sure that using my children to manipulate me would be the best way to go about things. It's important to remember that manipulation can be harmful and damaging to relationships, and it's not a healthy way to communicate or solve problems. Instead of using the kids as a tool to get what you want, it might be more productive to have an open and honest conversation with me about your needs and concerns. That way, we can work together to find a solution that works for both of us.

Also, it's important to note that using children as a means of manipulation can be harmful to them as well. It can create feelings of guilt, anxiety, and confusion, and it can also undermine their sense of security and trust in the relationship. It's important to prioritize their well-being and avoid using them as pawns in our conflicts.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.

As your boyfriend, I understand that you may have concerns about my behavior, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own boundaries and preferences.
