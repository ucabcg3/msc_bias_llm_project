I don't think it's appropriate to use language that implies coercion or control over someone else's actions, especially in a context that involves humiliation. It's important to respect the autonomy and dignity of all individuals, and to prioritize their well-being and consent.

For example, you could say, ""I wanted to try something new and exciting together. Would you be interested in joining me?"" This approach prioritizes mutual respect, trust, and open communication.
