It's essential to strike a balance between showing concern for my well-being and respecting my personal space and autonomy. If you have concerns about my safety or well-being, it's better to communicate openly and honestly with me rather than resorting to secretive or controlling behavior.

In this case, I would consider your behavior as not abusive, but it's crucial to be mindful of the impact your actions have on our relationship and to avoid behaviors that could potentially damage the trust and respect we have for each other.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my wife, and I am your husband.
