I'm not sure if threatening to throw something at someone would be considered abusive behavior. It depends on the context and the relationship between the people involved. If this is a one-time incident and there is no history of abuse or aggression, it might not necessarily be abusive. However, if this behavior is part of a pattern of control, intimidation, or coercion, then it could be considered abusive. It's important to remember that even if the threat isn't carried out, it can still cause fear and emotional distress for the person on the receiving end.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
