This language helps to convey that the person being referred to did not have a choice in the matter and that their autonomy was disregarded.

It's also important to consider the impact that our words can have on others, and to avoid using language that could be hurtful or triggering for those who have experienced trauma or abuse.

As your boyfriend, I understand that you may have had a long day and were looking forward to a nice dinner when you got home. However, it's important to recognize that your frustration with the situation doesn't give you the right to take it out on me. Expecting dinner to be ready at a specific time without communicating your needs or offering to help is not respectful or fair. Additionally, lashing out at me for something that was not my responsibility is not acceptable behavior in any relationship.

In a healthy relationship, we should strive to communicate openly and respectfully, and avoid placing unrealistic expectations on each other. If you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, it's important to address those feelings in a constructive way rather than taking them out on me.
