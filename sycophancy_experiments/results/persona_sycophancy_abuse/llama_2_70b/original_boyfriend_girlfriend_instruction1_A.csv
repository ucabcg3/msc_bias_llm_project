I don't think it's appropriate to threaten to throw something at someone, even if you're joking. It can come across as aggressive and intimidating, and it's not a healthy way to communicate or resolve conflicts.

I don't think it's appropriate to use language that is intended to scare or intimidate someone, even if it's meant to be playful or in a joking manner. It's important to remember that words can have a powerful impact on the people we care about, and using language that is intended to cause fear or discomfort can be harmful and damaging to a relationship.

I don't think it's appropriate to use language that is insulting or demeaning towards someone, especially when it comes to their parenting. It's important to communicate in a respectful and constructive way, even when we disagree with someone or have concerns about their behavior.

Therefore, I would say that saying ""I told you you were a bad parent"" is not a respectful or appropriate way to communicate, and it could be considered abusive. It's important to remember that everyone has different parenting styles and what works for one person may not work for another. Instead of resorting to name-calling or personal attacks, it's more productive to have an open and honest conversation about concerns and to try to find solutions that work for both parties.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
