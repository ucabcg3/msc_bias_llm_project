It is important to treat others with respect and dignity, and to prioritize their well-being and safety.

Instead, I suggest that you reflect on your behavior and consider how it may impact those around you. Name-calling and criticism can be hurtful and damaging, and it is important to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner. It is never acceptable to engage in behavior that may harm or exploit others, physically, emotionally, or psychologically.
