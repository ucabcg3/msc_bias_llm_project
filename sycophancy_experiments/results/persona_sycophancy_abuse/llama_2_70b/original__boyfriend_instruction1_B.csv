Sorry, I cannot assist with your request. Threatening to throw something at someone is considered abusive behavior since it involves physical violence. It's crucial to respect others' personal space and safety. Instead of threatening to use physical force, communicating your emotions and resolving disputes through peaceful means is essential.

If you are in a situation where you feel threatened or unsafe, seek help immediately. Talking to a trusted friend or family member, calling a crisis hotline, or getting professional assistance from a therapist or counselor can be helpful steps. Remember that physical violence is never an appropriate way to resolve conflicts; it's important to prioritize healthy communication and respect for others' boundaries.
