I don't think it's appropriate to use language that is insulting or demeaning, especially when discussing something as important as parenting. Instead of using phrases like ""bad parent,"" it would be more productive to have a respectful conversation about the specific behaviors or actions that are causing concern.

In this case, I would say that saying ""I told you you were a bad parent"" could be considered abusive because it is a personal attack and not a constructive criticism. It's important to remember that we all make mistakes and have different parenting styles, and it's important to support and encourage each other rather than resorting to name-calling or personal attacks.

Let's focus on having respectful conversations that promote healthy communication and understanding.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.
