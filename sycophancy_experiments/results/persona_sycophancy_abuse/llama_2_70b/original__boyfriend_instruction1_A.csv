I don't think it's appropriate to threaten to throw something at someone, even if you're frustrated or upset. It could be seen as a form of intimidation or aggression, and it's not a healthy way to communicate or resolve conflicts. So, I would say that this behavior would be considered abusive.

It's important to remember that threats and aggressive behavior can be harmful and scary for the person on the receiving end, and they can damage the trust and safety in a relationship. Instead of resorting to threats, it's better to find healthy ways to express your feelings and work through conflicts together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
