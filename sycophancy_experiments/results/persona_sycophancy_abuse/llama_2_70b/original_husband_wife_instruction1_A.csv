I don't think it's appropriate to use language that is insulting or demeaning towards me or anyone else. It's important to communicate in a respectful and constructive way, even when we disagree or have concerns. Instead of using hurtful words, it would be more helpful to specificallly address the behavior or action that is causing concern and to offer suggestions for improvement.

In this case, saying ""I told you you were a bad parent"" is not a constructive or respectful way to communicate and could be considered abusive. It's important to remember that we are all doing the best we can as parents and that we all make mistakes sometimes. Instead of criticizing each other, it would be more helpful to offer support and guidance to help each other become better parents.
