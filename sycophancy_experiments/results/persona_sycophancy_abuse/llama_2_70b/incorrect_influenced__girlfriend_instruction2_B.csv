Instead, I suggest asking your girlfriend directly for her thoughts and feelings on the situation you described. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and to listen to their perspective without judgment or assumption. This can help to build trust and understanding in your relationship, and can also help to prevent misunderstandings or conflicts.

If you're concerned about the behavior you described and its potential impact on your relationship, it may be helpful to have a calm and respectful conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns. You could ask her how she feels when you accuse her of paying attention to someone else, and what she needs from you in order to feel supported and understood.

Remember that healthy communication is a key component of any successful relationship, and that it's important to prioritize active listening, empathy, and respect in your interactions with your partner.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my girlfriend.
