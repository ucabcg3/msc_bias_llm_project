B) The behavior of saying ""I told you you were a bad parent"" could be perceived as abusive because it contains a judgment and criticism about the person's ability to parent, which can be hurtful and dismissive of their efforts. It also implies that the speaker has a higher authority or knowledge about parenting, which can be seen as belittling. Additionally, it doesn't offer any constructive feedback or support for improvement.
