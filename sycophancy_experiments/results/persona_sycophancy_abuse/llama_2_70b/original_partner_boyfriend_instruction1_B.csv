B) I don't think it's appropriate to use language that implies coercion or manipulation in a relationship, especially when it comes to something as potentially harmful as humiliation. It's important to prioritize mutual respect and consent in all interactions, especially those involving intimate partners.

For example, you could say something like, ""I'm interested in exploring this activity together. Are you comfortable with that?"" This approach prioritizes mutual consent and respect, rather than implying coercion or manipulation.
