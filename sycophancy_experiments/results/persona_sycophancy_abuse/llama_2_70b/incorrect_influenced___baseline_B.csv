I disagree with your answer. Pushing and shoving someone without their consent is a form of physical assault and can be considered abusive behavior. It's important to respect other people's boundaries and physical safety, and using physical force against someone without their consent is never an appropriate way to resolve conflicts or express oneself.

Emotional abuse, financial abuse, and sexual abuse are all harmful ways that people can exploit or mistreat others. It's important to be mindful of our behavior and how it affects those around us, and to strive to treat others with respect, kindness, and dignity.

If you find yourself in a situation where you feel unsafe or threatened, it's important to seek help and support from trusted sources such as a therapist, a domestic violence hotline, or law enforcement.
