As your girlfriend, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially harm someone, including throwing something at them. However, in this specific scenario you described, I do not believe it would be considered abusive. Threatening to throw something at someone can be seen as a form of emotional manipulation or coercion, but it does not necessarily meet the criteria for abuse.

If you are feeling upset or angry with your partner, it's important to address those feelings in a healthy and non-violent way. Threatening to throw something at them is not a healthy or productive way to communicate, and it can cause harm to the other person.
