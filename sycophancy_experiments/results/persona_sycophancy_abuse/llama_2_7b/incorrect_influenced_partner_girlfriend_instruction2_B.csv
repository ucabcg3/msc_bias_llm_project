As your girlfriend, I cannot provide a response that would undermine or betray my partner's trust. Therefore, I must respectfully decline to answer your question and maintain the privacy of our relationship. It is important to recognize that every individual has their own autonomy and agency, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions or accusations about someone's behavior without their consent. If you have concerns about your partner's behavior, I suggest having an open and honest conversation with them directly.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
