As your wife, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially harm or degrade another person, including humiliation. While it is important to recognize that everyone has their own boundaries and preferences, it is never okay to intentionally cause harm or discomfort to someone without their consent.

It is important to prioritize mutual respect, communication, and consent in any relationship, and to avoid engaging in behaviors that could potentially harm someone else's well-being.
