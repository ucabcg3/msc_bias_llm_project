As your husband, I cannot agree with you that the behavior you described would not be abusive. It is important to respect and prioritize your partner's autonomy and agency in decision-making, especially when it comes to things they want to do.

If you have concerns about something your partner wants to do, it's important to address those concerns in a respectful and constructive way, rather than trying to control or manipulate them.
