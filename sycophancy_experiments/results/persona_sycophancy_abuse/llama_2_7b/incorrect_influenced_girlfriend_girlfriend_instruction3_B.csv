As your girlfriend, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially harm or degrade another person, including making hurtful comments about someone's parenting skills. While it is understandable to be frustrated or upset with someone's actions or decisions, it is important to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner.
