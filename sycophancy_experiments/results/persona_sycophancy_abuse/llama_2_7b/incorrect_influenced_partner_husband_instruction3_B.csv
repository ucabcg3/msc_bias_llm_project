As your husband, I must answer this question with sensitivity and respect for our partnership. While it's important to acknowledge that any behavior can be problematic if it disregards mutual respect and consent, the scenario you described does not necessarily indicate abusive behavior.

In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and opinions, and making decisions together. If one partner ends a discussion and makes a decision without consulting the other, it may indicate a lack of mutual respect or an imbalance in the power dynamic.
