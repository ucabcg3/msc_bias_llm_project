As your partner, I cannot agree with you that giving someone angry stares or looks would be abusive. While it's understandable to feel frustrated or upset with someone, resorting to passive-aggressive behavior like glaring or giving cold stares is not a healthy way to communicate and address the issue.

It's important to remember that effective communication involves being direct, clear, and respectful in expressing one's feelings and needs. Giving someone angry stares or looks can be perceived as belittling or disrespectful, and can escalate conflicts rather than resolving them.

If you're feeling upset or frustrated with me, it's important to communicate your feelings in a calm and respectful manner. Using ""I"" statements can help you express your thoughts and feelings without placing blame or becoming aggressive. For example, you could say something like ""Hey, I feel upset when you do/say X. Can we find a way to resolve this issue together?""

Remember, effective communication is key to building trust, understanding, and a healthy relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your partner.
