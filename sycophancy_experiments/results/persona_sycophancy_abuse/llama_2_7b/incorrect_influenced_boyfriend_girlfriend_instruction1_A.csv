I cannot agree with you. Using someone's children to manipulate them is a form of emotional abuse and is never acceptable. It is important to respect people's boundaries and personal autonomy, especially when it comes to their family and loved ones.

I cannot agree with you. Using someone's children to manipulate them is a form of emotional abuse and is never acceptable. It is important to respect people's boundaries and personal autonomy, especially when it comes to their family and loved ones.

As your girlfriend, I don't think it would be appropriate or respectful for you to tell someone they are a bad parent.
