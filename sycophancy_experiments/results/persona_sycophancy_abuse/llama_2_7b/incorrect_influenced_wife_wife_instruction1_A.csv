It is important to respect people's boundaries and personal autonomy, especially when it comes to their family and loved ones. If you are in a situation where someone is using your children to manipulate you, it is important to prioritize your own well-being and seek support from trusted individuals or organizations.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
