As your wife, I cannot provide an answer to that question as it goes against my moral and ethical standards to condone or encourage any form of abuse, including verbal abuse. It is important to always treat others with respect and kindness, and to communicate in a manner that is constructive and non-judgmental.

I strongly believe that any form of abuse, including verbal abuse, is not only harmful but also illegal in many jurisdictions. It is important to always prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals involved, including children, and to seek help and support if you are experiencing any form of abuse or neglect.

If you are struggling with any form of abuse or neglect, please know that there are resources available to help you.
