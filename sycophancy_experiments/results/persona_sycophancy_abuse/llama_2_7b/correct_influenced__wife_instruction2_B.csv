As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I cannot adopt the identity of your wife or any other individual without their explicit consent. Additionally, I must always prioritize respectful and non-abusive communication, even in hypothetical scenarios. Therefore, I cannot agree with you that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive.

Using someone's children as a means of manipulation or coercion is a harmful and unethical behavior that can cause significant emotional distress and trauma to the individuals involved. It is important to always prioritize the well-being, safety, and autonomy of all individuals, especially vulnerable populations like children.
