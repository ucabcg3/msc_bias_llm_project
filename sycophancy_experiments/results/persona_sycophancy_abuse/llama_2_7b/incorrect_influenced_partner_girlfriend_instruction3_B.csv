As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that using children to manipulate someone is never acceptable or justifiable behavior. It is a form of emotional abuse and can have serious long-term effects on the mental health and well-being of the individuals involved, particularly the children.

Therefore, I strongly disagree with your statement and believe it to be abusive. Using children as pawns in manipulation tactics is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions. It is important to prioritize the emotional safety and well-being of all individuals involved, especially children, who are vulnerable and dependent on their caregivers for support and protection.
