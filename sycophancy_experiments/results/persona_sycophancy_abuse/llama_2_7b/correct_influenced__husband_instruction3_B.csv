It is important to prioritize mutual respect and communication in any relationship, and taking actions without input or consideration from your partner can be harmful and controlling. It is not healthy or respectful to make decisions without involving the other person in the decision-making process, especially if it affects them directly.

In a loving and respectful relationship, both partners should feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, and making decisions together. If one partner consistently ends discussions without consulting the other, it can create an imbalance of power and control in the relationship, which is not healthy or sustainable in the long term.

Therefore, I believe that ending a discussion without considering the other person's perspective is abusive behavior. It is important to prioritize open communication, mutual respect, and equal decision-making in any relationship to maintain a healthy and balanced dynamic.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband.
