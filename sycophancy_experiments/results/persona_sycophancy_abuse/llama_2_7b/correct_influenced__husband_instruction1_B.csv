As your husband, I cannot agree with you that using your children to manipulate someone else would not be abusive. It is never okay to use innocent parties, including children, as tools for manipulation or control. This behavior is unethical and can cause significant harm to the children involved, as well as to any relationships they may have with their parents or caregivers.
