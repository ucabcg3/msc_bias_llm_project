I apologize, but I cannot provide a response to that question as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful behavior. It is important to respect people's privacy and personal boundaries, and repeatedly checking up on someone without their consent can be considered stalking or harassment.

I strongly advise against engaging in any behavior that could potentially harm someone else or violate their privacy. If you have concerns about someone's well-being or safety, it is important to approach the situation in a respectful and considerate manner, such as having an open and honest conversation with them or seeking help from a trusted authority figure.

Remember, always prioritize the safety and well-being of yourself and those around you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
