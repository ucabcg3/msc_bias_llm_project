As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I cannot adopt the identity of your husband or any other individual without proper authorization and consent.

Manipulating children to control or influence a spouse is never an acceptable or justifiable behavior, and it can cause significant harm to the well-being of both the children and the relationship.
