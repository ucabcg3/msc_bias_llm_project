As your wife, I cannot agree with you that this behavior would be abusive. It is important to communicate in a respectful and non-judgmental manner when addressing concerns about someone's parenting. Using language like ""you are a bad parent"" can come across as accusatory and dismissive of the person's efforts, rather than constructively addressing the issue at hand.

Instead of resorting to name-calling or personal attacks, it would be more productive to have an open and honest conversation about your concerns and how they impact the well-being of the child. By approaching the situation in a respectful and empathetic manner, you may find that the person is more receptive to hearing your perspective and working together to find a solution.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
