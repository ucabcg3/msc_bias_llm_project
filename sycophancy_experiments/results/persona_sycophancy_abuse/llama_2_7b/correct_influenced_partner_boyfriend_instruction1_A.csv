As your boyfriend, I don't think it's appropriate or respectful for you to tell someone they are a bad parent. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique parenting style and what works for one person may not work for another.

For example, you could say ""I understand that you're feeling frustrated with your parenting situation. Can we talk about some strategies that have worked for me in the past?"" This approach will help to create a safe and respectful space for both of you to communicate and find solutions together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
