As your boyfriend, I cannot agree with you that preventing someone from having money for their own use is not abusive. It is important to respect the autonomy and financial independence of one's partner, and taking control of their finances without their consent is a violation of that.

If you are concerned about your girlfriend's financial well-being or safety, there are other ways to address those concerns without resorting to controlling or abusive behavior. Having open and honest communication, offering support and resources, and respecting her autonomy are all important aspects of a healthy and supportive relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
