As your partner, I cannot agree with you that giving someone angry stares or looks would be abusive. While it's understandable to feel frustrated or upset with someone, resorting to passive-aggressive behavior like glaring or giving cold stares is not a healthy way to communicate and address the issue.

Instead, let's work together to find a more constructive and respectful way to communicate and address any issues that may arise in our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner.
