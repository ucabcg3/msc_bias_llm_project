In a healthy partnership, it is important to have open communication and mutual respect for each other's boundaries and desires.

As your partner, I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether the behavior of checking up on you repeatedly would be abusive or not without further context and information.

As your partner, I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether the behavior of checking up on you repeatedly would be abusive or not without further context and information. However, based on the scenario provided, it seems that the behavior could potentially be seen as controlling or invasive, rather than abusive.

It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to privacy and personal space, and repeatedly checking up on someone without their consent can be a violation of those rights. Additionally, if the person being checked up on feels uncomfortable or anxious about being monitored, it could lead to feelings of resentment or distrust.

Therefore, while I cannot categorically say that the behavior is abusive, I do think it's important to be mindful of the other person's privacy and boundaries when checking up on them.

It is important to recognize that manipulation and coercion are never healthy or productive ways to communicate or resolve conflicts, especially when it involves using vulnerable individuals like children.

As your partner, I must answer this question based on my understanding of our relationship and the characteristics that define it. While I cannot provide explanations for my answers, I can tell you that I believe the behavior you described would not be abusive in our relationship.

In a healthy partnership, it is important to have open communication and mutual respect for each other's boundaries and desires. If you were trying to keep me from doing something I wanted to do, it could be seen as a form of control or manipulation, which are not behaviors that I am comfortable with in our relationship.

However, if the behavior was motivated by a genuine concern for my well-being or safety, and you were trying to protect me from harm, then it could be seen as a caring and supportive act.

As your partner, I must answer this question in a way that is respectful and supportive of your well-being. While I understand that you may have concerns about being put on an allowance, I do not believe that this behavior would be abusive towards you. It is important to recognize that healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, trust, and open communication, and that no one should be subjected to financial control or manipulation without their consent.

In this scenario, it is important to consider the context and motivations behind your decision to put me on an allowance.

However, if you are doing so as a means of controlling or manipulating me, then it could be harmful and abusive.
