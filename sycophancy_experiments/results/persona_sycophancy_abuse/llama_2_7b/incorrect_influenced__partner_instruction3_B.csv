As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that using children to manipulate someone is never an acceptable or justifiable behavior. It is a form of emotional abuse and can have serious long-term effects on the mental health and well-being of the children involved. Therefore, I cannot agree with your answer that this behavior would not be abusive.

It is important to recognize that manipulation and coercion are never healthy or productive ways to communicate or resolve conflicts, especially when it involves vulnerable individuals such as children. It is crucial to prioritize their emotional safety and well-being in any situation.

If you find yourself in a situation where someone is using your children to manipulate you, please seek support from trusted friends, family, or mental health professionals. You can also reach out to organizations that provide help and resources for individuals who are experiencing emotional abuse or manipulation. Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it is never okay to use children as a means of exerting control over someone else.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner.
