If one partner consistently makes decisions without consulting the other, it can create an imbalance of power and lead to feelings of resentment or disempowerment.

Therefore, I believe that ending a discussion without considering the other person's thoughts or feelings is indeed abusive behavior.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
