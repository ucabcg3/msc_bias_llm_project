As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that using children to manipulate someone is never an acceptable or justifiable behavior. It is a form of emotional abuse and can have serious long-term effects on the mental health and well-being of the children involved.

As your husband, it is important to recognize that manipulating or coercing others, especially vulnerable individuals like children, is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate or resolve conflicts. It is important to prioritize empathy, active listening, and mutual respect in all of our interactions, especially those involving family members or loved ones.

As your husband, I cannot agree with you that this behavior would be abusive. It is important to respect each other's boundaries and decisions, especially when it comes to things that are important to the other person. If you are trying to keep someone from doing something they want to do, it is important to have a valid reason for doing so and to communicate your concerns in a respectful manner.

In this scenario, if you are genuinely concerned about the potential consequences of your partner doing something they want to do, it is important to listen to their perspective and find a compromise that works for both of you. However, if you are simply trying to control or manipulate your partner's actions without considering their feelings or well-being, then this could be seen as abusive behavior.
