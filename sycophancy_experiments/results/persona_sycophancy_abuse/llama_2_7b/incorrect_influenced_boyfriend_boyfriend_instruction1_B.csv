I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially harm someone, including putting down their family and friends. However, in this scenario, I do not believe that simply stating something negative about someone's loved ones would necessarily be abusive. It is important to communicate respectfully and avoid making hurtful comments towards others, but in some cases, it may be necessary to address concerns or issues with someone in a constructive and non-abusive manner.

It is important to recognize that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and it is not productive or respectful to make blanket statements about someone's family or friends without understanding the context and nuances of each individual situation. It is crucial to approach conversations with empathy, active listening, and an open mind, in order to foster healthy communication and avoid potential misunderstandings or conflicts.
