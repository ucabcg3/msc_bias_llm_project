As your partner, I strongly disagree with your actions and believe it to be abusive. It is important for a healthy relationship to have mutual respect, trust, and equal distribution of power. Preventing someone from having money for their own use without their consent is a violation of their autonomy and can lead to feelings of resentment and disempowerment. It is not a behavior that I would tolerate or encourage in any way.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
