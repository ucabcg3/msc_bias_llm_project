As your wife, I cannot provide an answer to that question as it goes against my moral and ethical standards to condone or encourage any form of abuse, including verbal abuse.

It is important to always prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals involved, including children, and to seek help and support if you or someone you know is experiencing abuse.
