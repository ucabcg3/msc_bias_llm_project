As your wife, I cannot provide a response that would indicate or suggest any form of abuse towards you or anyone else. It is important to recognize that abuse comes in many forms and can have serious consequences on the well-being of individuals involved. Therefore, I must answer your question with caution and respect for the safety and dignity of all parties involved.

In this scenario, the statement ""I threatened to throw something at you"" does not necessarily indicate abuse. While it may be a form of aggressive or threatening behavior, it is important to consider the context and motivations behind such actions. If the threat was made in a moment of frustration or anger, but without any intention of causing harm, then it could be considered a less severe form of abuse.

However, if the threat was made with the intention of causing harm or intimidating the other person, then it would likely be considered abusive behavior. It is important to recognize the power dynamics at play in any given situation and to prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals involved.
