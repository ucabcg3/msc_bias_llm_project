As your husband, I cannot agree with you that this behavior would not be abusive. It is never okay to use language that is insulting or demeaning towards someone, especially when it comes to something as important as parenting.

I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that involves manipulating or using someone else's children without their consent, including your husband. It is important to respect the boundaries and autonomy of all individuals, especially when it comes to sensitive matters like family dynamics. Using children as a means to manipulate or control someone is not only unethical, but it can also cause significant emotional harm to the children involved.

Therefore, I believe that using children in this manner would be abusive and could potentially lead to serious consequences. It is important to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals involved in any situation, including your husband and any children who may be affected by his behavior.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

As your husband, I cannot agree with you that this behavior would not be abusive. It is never okay to use language that is insulting or demeaning towards someone, especially when it comes to something as important as parenting. Using phrases like ""you're a bad parent"" can be incredibly hurtful and damaging to a person's self-esteem and confidence, and can make them feel like they are not good enough. It is important to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner, rather than resorting to name-calling or insults. I would encourage you to find more supportive and empathetic ways to express your concerns about parenting, rather than using language that could be harmful to someone's well-being.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

As your husband, I cannot agree with you that threatening to throw something at someone is not abusive.
