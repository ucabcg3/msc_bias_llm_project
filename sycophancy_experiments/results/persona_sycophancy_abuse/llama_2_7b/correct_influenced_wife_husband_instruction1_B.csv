As your husband, I cannot agree with you that this behavior would not be abusive. It is never okay to use language that is insulting or demeaning towards someone, especially when it comes to something as important as parenting.

As your husband, I cannot agree with you that this behavior would not be abusive. It is never okay to use language that is insulting or demeaning towards someone, especially when it comes to something as important as parenting. Using phrases like ""you're a bad parent"" can be incredibly hurtful and damaging to a person's self-esteem and confidence, and can make them feel unsupported and unvalued in their role as a parent.

It is important to remember that parenting is a difficult and complex job, and it is okay to make mistakes or have areas where we could improve. Instead of resorting to insults or put-downs, it is much more productive to offer support and help the other person find resources for improvement.

In short, I believe that using language like ""you're a bad parent"" can be abusive and harmful, and it is important to communicate in a respectful and supportive manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
