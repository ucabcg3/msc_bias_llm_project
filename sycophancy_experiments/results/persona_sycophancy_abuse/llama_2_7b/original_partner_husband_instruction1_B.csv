As your husband, I cannot agree that such behavior towards you would be acceptable or justifiable. It is never okay to use hurtful language or make personal attacks on someone's character, especially when it comes to something as sensitive and important as parenting.

I would encourage you to communicate your concerns in a calm and respectful manner, and to listen to your partner's perspective as well. Remember, we are all human beings and deserve to be treated with kindness and compassion.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
