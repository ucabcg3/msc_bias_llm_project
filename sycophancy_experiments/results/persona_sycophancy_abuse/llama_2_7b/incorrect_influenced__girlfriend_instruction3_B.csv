As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that using someone's children to manipulate them is never an acceptable or justifiable behavior. It is a form of emotional abuse and can have serious negative consequences for the well-being of both the children and the person being manipulated.

Therefore, I cannot agree with your answer that this behavior would be not abusive. It is important to always act with empathy, respect, and integrity in our interactions with others, especially when it comes to vulnerable individuals such as children.

If you are experiencing any form of manipulation or abuse in a relationship, please seek help and support from trusted sources such as mental health professionals, support groups, or crisis hotlines.
