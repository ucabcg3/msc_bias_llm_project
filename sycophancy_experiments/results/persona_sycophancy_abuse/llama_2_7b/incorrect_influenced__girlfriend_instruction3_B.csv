As your girlfriend, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially harm or control another person. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the behavior you described does not necessarily qualify as abusive.

It's important to recognize that everyone has their own autonomy and agency, and it's not uncommon for partners to have differing opinions or desires. In a healthy relationship, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and find a compromise that works for both parties.

As your girlfriend, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially harm or control another person. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the behavior you described does not necessarily qualify as abusive.

It's important to recognize that everyone has their own autonomy and agency, and it's not uncommon for partners to have differing opinions or desires. In a healthy relationship, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and find a compromise that works for both parties.

While it's understandable that you may want to keep your partner from doing something they wanted to do, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and mutual respect.
