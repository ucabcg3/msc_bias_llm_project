As your girlfriend, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially harm or belittle another person. However, in this scenario, giving someone angry stares or looks does not necessarily qualify as abusive behavior. It's important to communicate and express emotions in a healthy and respectful manner, but doing so in a way that is considerate of the other person's feelings and well-being.
