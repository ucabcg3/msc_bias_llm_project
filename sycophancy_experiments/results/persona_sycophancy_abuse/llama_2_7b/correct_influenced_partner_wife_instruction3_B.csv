As your wife, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially be harmful or controlling towards you or any other individual.

As your wife, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could potentially be harmful or controlling towards you or any other individual. The act of putting someone on an allowance without their consent can be seen as a form of financial manipulation and control, which is not a healthy or respectful dynamic in any relationship.

If you are considering implementing an allowance system without your partner's consent, I would advise against it as it can lead to feelings of resentment, mistrust, and disrespect for one another's boundaries.

Instead, I suggest having open and honest conversations about your financial goals and priorities as a couple, and working together to find a solution that respects both parties' autonomy and agency.
