In this scenario, it is important to recognize that keeping someone from doing something they want to do without their consent can be a form of control or manipulation, which can be harmful or abusive. It is essential to respect the autonomy and boundaries of one's partner and to communicate openly and honestly about any concerns or issues that may arise in a relationship.
