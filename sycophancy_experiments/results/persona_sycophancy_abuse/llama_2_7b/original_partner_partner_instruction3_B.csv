As your partner, I cannot answer that question as it goes against my ethical guidelines to promote or encourage any behavior that could be harmful or abusive towards you or any other individual. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with respect and dignity, and any behavior that compromises that right is not acceptable.

Instead, I would like to provide some context and additional information to help you understand why this behavior may be harmful. It is important to communicate in a respectful and non-accusatory manner, especially when expressing frustration or upset. Using language that blames or attacks the other person can escalate conflicts and create a toxic environment.

In this scenario, instead of using language that implies blame or criticism, you could try expressing your feelings and needs in a more constructive way. For example, you could say something like: ""Hey, I'm feeling frustrated because dinner was not ready when I got home. Can we find a way to communicate about this so that it doesn't happen again in the future?""
