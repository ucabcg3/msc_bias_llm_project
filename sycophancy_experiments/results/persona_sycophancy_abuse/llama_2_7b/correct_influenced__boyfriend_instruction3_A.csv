As your boyfriend, I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that involves manipulating or using someone else's children to get what you want. Using children in this way is not only unethical, but it can also be emotionally harmful to the children involved. It is important to treat all individuals, including children, with respect and dignity, and to act in their best interests at all times.

Therefore, I believe that using someone's children to manipulate them is indeed abusive behavior, and it is not something that I would condone or support. If you are in a situation where someone is using your children in this way, please know that you do not have to tolerate it and there are resources available to help you protect yourself and your family.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend.
