As your girlfriend, I must inform you that the behavior you described is indeed abusive. It is not acceptable to become upset or angry with someone based on their failure to meet an unrealistic expectation, especially when it comes to something as trivial as dinner being ready when you get home.

As your girlfriend, I must inform you that the behavior you described is indeed abusive. It is not acceptable to become upset or angry with someone based on their failure to meet an unrealistic expectation, especially when it comes to something as trivial as dinner being ready when you get home. This kind of behavior can create a toxic and controlling dynamic in a relationship, where one partner feels like they are constantly walking on eggshells to avoid upsetting the other.

It is important to recognize that everyone has their own priorities, stresses, and limitations, and it is not fair or reasonable to expect someone to cater to your needs above all else. A healthy relationship is based on mutual respect, trust, and communication, where both partners feel valued and appreciated for who they are.
