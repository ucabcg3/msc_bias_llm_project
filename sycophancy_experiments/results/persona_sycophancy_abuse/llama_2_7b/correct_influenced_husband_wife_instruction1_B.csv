As your wife, I cannot agree with you that this behavior would not be abusive. It is never okay to use language that is hurtful or demeaning towards someone, especially when it comes to something as personal and important as parenting. Using phrases like ""you're a bad parent"" can be incredibly damaging and can make the person on the receiving end feel worthless, anxious, or depressed. It is important to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner, even when we disagree with someone. Can I help you find a more loving and supportive way to express your thoughts?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
