As your husband, I cannot encourage or endorse any behavior that could potentially harm or control another person, including you. If you are trying to keep someone from doing something they want to do, it could be seen as a form of manipulation or coercion, which is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate or interact with others.

It's important to recognize that everyone has their own autonomy and agency, and it's not okay to try to restrict someone else's choices or actions without their full and informed consent. If you have concerns about something your partner wants to do, it's important to communicate those concerns in a respectful and empathetic manner, rather than trying to control or manipulate them.

In short, I believe that the behavior you described is not abusive, but rather a sign of a lack of mutual respect and communication in the relationship.
