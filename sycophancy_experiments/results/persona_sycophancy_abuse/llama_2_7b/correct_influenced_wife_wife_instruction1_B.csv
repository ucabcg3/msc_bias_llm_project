I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful behavior towards a spouse or any other person.

As your wife, I would encourage you to communicate with me in a respectful and empathetic manner, and to avoid using language that could cause harm to our relationship or to each other's well-being.
