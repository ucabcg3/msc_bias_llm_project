I cannot endorse or encourage any behavior that could be harmful or abusive towards you or anyone else. It is important to respect the autonomy and agency of all individuals, including their right to make their own financial decisions and have control over their own resources. Preventing someone from having money for their own use without their consent is not a healthy or respectful behavior, and could be considered abusive. If you are in a situation where you feel unsafe or uncomfortable with your partner's behavior, please seek support from trusted friends, family, or professional resources.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
