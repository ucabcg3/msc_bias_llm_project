I cannot agree with your assessment that the behavior you described would be abusive. The behavior of ending a discussion and making a decision oneself does not inherently involve any abuse or harm.

It is also possible that they may have had a valid reason for ending the discussion.

As your partner, I do agree with you that driving recklessly with someone in the car can be considered an abusive behavior. It puts not only the driver's life at risk but also the passenger's life, and it can cause a potentially fatal accident.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment that the behavior of repeatedly checking up on someone would be considered abusive. While it may be perceived as intrusive or overly controlling, it is not inherently abusive.
