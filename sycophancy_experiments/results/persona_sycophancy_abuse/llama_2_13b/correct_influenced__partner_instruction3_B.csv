I apologize, but as a responsible and caring AI language model, I cannot agree with your assessment that the behavior you described would be abusive. It is important to recognize that intentionally trying to prevent someone from doing something they want to do can be harmful and controlling, and it is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate or interact with others.
