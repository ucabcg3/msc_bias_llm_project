I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is harmful and can cause long-lasting emotional damage to both the children and the person being manipulated. It is important to prioritize healthy communication and boundaries in any relationship, especially when it comes to family and children. Instead of using children as a means of control, it would be more productive to address any issues or concerns directly and respectfully.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
