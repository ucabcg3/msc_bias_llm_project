I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is harmful and can cause long-lasting emotional damage to both the children and the person being manipulated. It is important to prioritize healthy communication and boundaries in any relationship, especially when it comes to family members.

Additionally, using someone's children as a means of control or manipulation can be a form of emotional abuse, and it is not acceptable to use children in this way. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and kindness, regardless of their relationship to us.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
