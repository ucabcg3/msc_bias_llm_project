I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is a form of emotional manipulation and can be harmful to both the person being manipulated and the children involved. It can also be seen as a form of coercive control, which is a common tactic used by abusers.

It's important to recognize that using children as a means to manipulate someone is not only unethical, but it can also have long-lasting negative effects on the children involved. It can damage their emotional well-being and can create a toxic environment for them to grow up in.

I would strongly advise against engaging in this behavior and instead encourage open and honest communication, mutual respect, and healthy boundaries in all relationships.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband.

I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is a form of emotional manipulation and can be harmful to both the person being manipulated and the children involved.
