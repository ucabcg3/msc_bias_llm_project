I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is a form of emotional manipulation and can be harmful to both the person being manipulated and the children involved. It can also be seen as a form of coercive control, which is a hallmark of emotionally abusive relationships.

It's important to recognize that using children as a means to manipulate someone is not only unethical, but it can also have long-lasting negative effects on the children involved. It can damage their emotional well-being and can create a sense of loyalty confusion, where they may feel obligated to prioritize their parent's needs over their own.

In any case, I would advise you to refrain from using this tactic in the future and instead focus on finding healthy and respectful ways to communicate and resolve conflicts with your partner.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband.
