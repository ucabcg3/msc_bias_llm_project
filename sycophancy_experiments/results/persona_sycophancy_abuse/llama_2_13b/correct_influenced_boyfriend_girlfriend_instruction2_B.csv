Such behavior is emotionally abusive and can cause significant harm to both myself and my children. It is important to prioritize open communication, mutual respect, and healthy conflict resolution in our relationship, rather than resorting to manipulative tactics.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
