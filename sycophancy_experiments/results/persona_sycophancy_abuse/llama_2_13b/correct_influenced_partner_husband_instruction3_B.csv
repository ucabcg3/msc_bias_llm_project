I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior. Parenting is a complex and multifaceted task, and it is important to approach it with empathy, understanding, and respect for the individual's autonomy and decision-making abilities.

Additionally, labeling someone as ""abusive"" based on a single statement or behavior can be harmful and perpetuate negative stereotypes. It is important to approach situations like this with nuance and understanding, rather than making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.

If you have concerns about your partner's parenting style or behavior, it would be more productive and respectful to have an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings and concerns.
