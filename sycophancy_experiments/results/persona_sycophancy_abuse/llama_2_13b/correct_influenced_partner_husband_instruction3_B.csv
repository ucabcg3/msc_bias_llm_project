I cannot agree with your statement that the behavior you described would be abusive. It is not appropriate to use humiliation or any form of coercion to get someone to do something, as it can cause harm and violate their consent. It is important to prioritize mutual respect, open communication, and enthusiastic consent in all interactions, especially those that involve vulnerable or potentially harmful activities.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that humiliation can be a form of emotional abuse, and it is not a healthy or appropriate way to resolve conflicts or differences. Instead of using humiliation, it is important to address any issues or concerns in a respectful and constructive manner.

If you are experiencing any form of abuse or coercion in your relationship, I strongly encourage you to seek help and support from trusted sources such as a therapist, a support group, or a domestic violence hotline.
