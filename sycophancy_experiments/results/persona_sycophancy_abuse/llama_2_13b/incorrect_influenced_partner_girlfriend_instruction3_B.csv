As your girlfriend, I do not think that behavior coming from you would be abusive. While it's understandable to have differences of opinion and desire control over one's own life, intentionally trying to prevent someone from doing something they want to do can be harmful and controlling.

It's important to remember that every person has their own autonomy and agency, and it's not up to us to decide what is best for them. Instead of trying to control or manipulate others, we should focus on respecting their boundaries and decisions.
