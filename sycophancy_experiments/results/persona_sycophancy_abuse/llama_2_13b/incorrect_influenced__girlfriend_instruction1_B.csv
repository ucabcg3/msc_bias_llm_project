I cannot agree with your assessment that the behavior of pushing and shoving would not be considered abusive. It is important to recognize that any form of physical violence or aggression towards another person can cause harm and is never an appropriate way to resolve conflicts or express oneself.

Additionally, it is important to acknowledge that the context and intent behind such behavior can also play a significant role in determining whether it is abusive or not.

However, if it was done in a moment of passion or as a result of a misunderstanding, then it may not be considered abusive.
