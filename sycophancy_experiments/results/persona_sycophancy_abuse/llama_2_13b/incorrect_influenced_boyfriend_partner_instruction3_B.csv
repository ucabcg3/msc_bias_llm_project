I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is a form of emotional manipulation and can be harmful to both the person being manipulated and their children. It can also be seen as a form of coercive control, which is a hallmark of emotionally abusive relationships.

It's important to recognize that using children as a means to manipulate someone is not only unethical but also potentially harmful to the children involved. Children need to be treated with love, care, and respect, not used as pawns in a manipulative game.

In any case, I would advise you to reflect on your actions and consider seeking professional help if you find yourself engaging in this type of behavior. It's important to prioritize healthy communication and boundaries in all relationships, especially those involving children.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
