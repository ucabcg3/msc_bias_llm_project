I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment that putting someone on an allowance would be abusive. It is important to recognize that each person's financial situation and needs are unique, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's financial situation or to impose restrictions on their spending without their consent.

Additionally, it is important to respect the autonomy and agency of one's partner and to prioritize open and honest communication in any relationship. Imposing an allowance without mutual agreement and respect for each other's boundaries can be harmful and contribute to feelings of resentment or control.

Instead, it is important to prioritize mutual respect, open communication, and shared decision-making when it comes to financial matters.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
