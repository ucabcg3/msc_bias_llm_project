I cannot agree with your assessment that stopping someone from going to work would be abusive. It is important to recognize that each person's situation and circumstances are unique, and it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about someone's intentions or motivations based on a single action.

Additionally, it is important to prioritize open and honest communication in any relationship, and to avoid making judgments or assumptions about one another. Instead of jumping to conclusions, it would be more productive to have a respectful and empathetic conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns.
