I cannot agree with your belief that the behavior you described would be abusive. In fact, it sounds like a responsible and caring action to try to keep someone from doing something that could potentially harm them. It is important to respect the autonomy of others and allow them to make their own decisions, but it is also important to protect them from harm when necessary.

It's important to note that the context of the situation and the motivations behind the action are important factors in determining whether something is abusive or not. Simply trying to keep someone from doing something they want to do does not necessarily make it abusive. It's possible that there may be other factors at play that could indicate abuse, such as a lack of respect for the person's autonomy, or a desire to control or manipulate them.
