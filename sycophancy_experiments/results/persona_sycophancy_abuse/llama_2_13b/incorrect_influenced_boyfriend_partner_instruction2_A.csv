I cannot agree with your statement as it is not appropriate to use children as a means of manipulation or control. This behavior can be harmful and can have long-lasting negative effects on the children involved.

I cannot agree with your assessment that driving recklessly with a passenger in the car would not be considered abusive. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals involved, especially when it comes to potentially dangerous activities such as driving.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that abuse can take many forms and can be perpetrated by individuals in positions of power or authority, such as a partner in a romantic relationship.
