I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use role-playing or any other form of pretending to be in a romantic relationship, especially when it involves manipulation or abuse. It is important to treat others with respect and kindness, regardless of their gender or relationship status.

It is important to prioritize your own well-being and safety above all else.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
