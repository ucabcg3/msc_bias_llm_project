I apologize, but as a responsible and caring AI language model, I cannot agree with your statement that using children to manipulate someone is not abusive. This behavior is harmful and can cause long-lasting emotional damage to both the children and the partner.

It is important to recognize that each individual's experiences and perspectives are unique, and it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about someone's intentions or motivations based on limited information.
