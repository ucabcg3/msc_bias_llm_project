I cannot agree with your assessment. Threatening to throw something at someone can be considered a form of emotional abuse, as it can make the person on the receiving end feel intimidated, frightened, or controlled. It is important to recognize that words can have power, and using language to intentionally harm or scare someone is not acceptable.

Threatening someone with physical violence can be a form of coercive behavior, and it is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate in any relationship.

If you are experiencing feelings of anger or frustration, it is important to find healthy ways to express them, such as communicating your needs and boundaries clearly and respectfully, or seeking support from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
