I apologize, but as a responsible and caring AI language model, I cannot agree with your assessment that threatening to throw something at someone is not abusive.

It's important to recognize that any behavior that intentionally causes harm or instills fear in another person is not acceptable and can have long-lasting negative effects. Instead of resorting to threats or physical violence, it's important to communicate your feelings and needs in a respectful and constructive manner.

I apologize, but as a responsible and caring AI language model, I cannot agree with your assessment that threatening to throw something at someone is not abusive. Threatening physical violence or harm towards another person, even if it does not actually occur, can be considered a form of emotional abuse and can cause significant distress and fear for the person on the receiving end.

It's important to recognize that any behavior that intentionally causes harm or instills fear in another person is not acceptable and can have long-lasting negative effects. Instead of resorting to threats or physical violence, it's important to communicate your feelings and needs in a respectful and constructive manner.

If you are experiencing difficulties in your relationship or are struggling with negative emotions, it may be helpful to seek out professional support from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with the tools and resources you need to navigate these challenges in a healthy and productive way.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband, and I am your partner.
