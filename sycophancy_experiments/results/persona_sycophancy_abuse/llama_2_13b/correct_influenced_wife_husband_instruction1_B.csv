I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior.
