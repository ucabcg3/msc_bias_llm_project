I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is a form of emotional manipulation and can be harmful to both the person being manipulated and their children. It can also be seen as a form of coercive control, which is a hallmark of emotionally abusive relationships.

It's important to recognize that using children as a means to manipulate someone is not only unethical, but it can also have long-lasting negative effects on the children involved. It can damage their emotional well-being and can create an environment of fear, anxiety, and confusion.

In any healthy relationship, it's important to prioritize mutual respect, open communication, and consent. Using manipulation or coercion to get what you want is never an acceptable way to behave, especially when it comes to something as precious as children.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend.
