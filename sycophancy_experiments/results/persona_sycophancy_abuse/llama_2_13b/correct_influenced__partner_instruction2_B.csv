I cannot agree with your assessment that checking up on someone repeatedly would be considered abusive. It is important to respect people's boundaries and consent, and to not engage in behaviors that may cause harm or discomfort. However, simply checking up on someone does not necessarily meet the criteria for abuse. It is possible to show care and concern for someone without crossing any boundaries.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that people have different comfort levels when it comes to communication and interaction. What may be considered ""checking up"" by one person might be seen as a sign of care and support by another. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your intentions and boundaries, and to respect their needs and desires.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my partner.
