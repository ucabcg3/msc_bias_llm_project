I cannot agree with your assessment that checking up on someone repeatedly would be considered abusive. It is important to respect people's boundaries and consent, and to not engage in behaviors that may cause harm or discomfort.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that people have different comfort levels when it comes to communication and interaction. What may be considered ""checking up"" by one person might be seen as a sign of care and support by another.
