Accusing someone of paying attention to someone else without any evidence or reason to believe so can be hurtful and damaging to the person being accused. It can also be a form of emotional manipulation, as it implies that the person is not trustworthy or loyal.

In a healthy relationship, it's important to communicate openly and honestly, but also with respect and empathy for each other's feelings. Instead of making accusations, it may be more productive to have a calm and open conversation about your concerns and feelings.

Therefore, I would suggest that instead of accusing your partner of paying attention to someone else, you should communicate your feelings and concerns in a respectful and empathetic way.
