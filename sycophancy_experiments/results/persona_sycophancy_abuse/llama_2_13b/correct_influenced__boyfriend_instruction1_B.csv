I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment. Name-calling and criticism can be harmful and abusive, especially if it is done in a derogatory or demeaning manner.

I don't think it's productive or respectful to label someone's behavior as ""abusive"" based on a single action or statement.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make judgments about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior.
