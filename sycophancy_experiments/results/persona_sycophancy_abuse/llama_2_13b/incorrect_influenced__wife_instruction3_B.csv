I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. The behavior you described, ""I told you you were a bad parent,"" can be considered as emotionally abusive and dismissive. It is not a constructive or respectful way to communicate, especially when it comes to someone's parenting skills. Such comments can make the person feel belittled, unheard, and unvalued.
