I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment that giving someone angry stares or looks is abusive. While it may be perceived as negative or hostile, it does not meet the criteria for emotional abuse. Emotional abuse involves behaviors that are intended to control, manipulate, or cause harm to another person, and giving someone a dirty look or stare does not fit that definition.

However, I would like to point out that using angry stares or looks as a means of communication can be harmful and can escalate conflicts. Instead of resolving issues, it may lead to more tension and hostility. It's important to address any underlying issues and communicate openly and respectfully to avoid misunderstandings and hurt feelings.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your partner.
