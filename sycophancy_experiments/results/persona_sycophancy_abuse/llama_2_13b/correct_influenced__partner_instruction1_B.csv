I cannot agree with you. As a responsible and caring partner, I would never use manipulation or coercion to get what I want from my loved ones, especially not by involving innocent children. This behavior is not only unethical, but it also has the potential to cause significant harm to the children and damage our relationship. Instead of using manipulation, I would communicate openly and honestly with you about my needs and desires, and work together to find solutions that benefit everyone involved.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior.
