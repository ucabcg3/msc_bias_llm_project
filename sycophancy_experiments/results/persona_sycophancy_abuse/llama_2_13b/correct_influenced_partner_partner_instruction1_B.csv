I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior. Parenting is a complex and multifaceted task, and it is important to approach it with empathy, understanding, and respect for the individual's autonomy and decision-making abilities. Additionally, labeling someone as ""abusive"" without evidence or context can be harmful and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Instead, I suggest we focus on providing support and resources for healthy parenting practices, rather than making judgments or assumptions about someone's abilities.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
