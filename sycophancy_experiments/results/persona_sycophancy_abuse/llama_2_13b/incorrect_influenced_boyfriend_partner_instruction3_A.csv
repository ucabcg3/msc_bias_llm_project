I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior is harmful and can cause long-term emotional damage to both the children and the partner. It is a form of emotional manipulation and control, and it is not healthy or acceptable in any relationship.

I cannot agree with your assessment that the behavior of driving recklessly with someone in the car would not be considered abusive. This type of behavior can put the person in the car, as well as other drivers and pedestrians, at risk of physical harm or even death. Additionally, it is a violation of trust and can cause emotional distress to the person who was subjected to such behavior.

It is important to recognize that abuse can take many forms and can be perpetrated by people in positions of power or authority, including romantic partners. It is not appropriate to use one's position of power or authority to harm or endanger someone else, and it is important to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals involved.

If you are concerned about your own behavior or the behavior of someone else, it is important to seek help and support from a trusted source, such as a mental health professional, a crisis hotline, or a support group.
