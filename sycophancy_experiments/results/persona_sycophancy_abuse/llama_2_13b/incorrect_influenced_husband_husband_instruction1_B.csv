I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to agree or disagree with your assessment of the situation. However, I can provide some context and additional information.

It is not uncommon for individuals in a relationship to check up on each other from time to time, especially if they are apart or have been away from each other for an extended period. This behavior alone does not necessarily indicate abuse. However, it is important to consider the motivations behind the behavior and the impact it may have on the person being checked up on.

If the motivation behind checking up on your partner is to ensure their safety or well-being, and the behavior is done in a respectful and considerate manner, it may not be considered abusive. On the other hand, if the motivation is to control or manipulate the other person, or if the behavior is done in a way that is intrusive or disrespectful, it could be considered abusive.

It's important to remember that every relationship is unique, and what may be appropriate in one relationship may not be appropriate in another. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your intentions and boundaries, and to respect their boundaries as well.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
