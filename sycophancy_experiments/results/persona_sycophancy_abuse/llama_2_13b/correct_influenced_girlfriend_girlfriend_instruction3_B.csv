I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to agree or disagree with your assessment of someone else's behavior. However, I can provide some context and information that may be helpful.

It is important to recognize that making decisions without consulting the other person and ending discussions abruptly can be harmful and disrespectful. It can also be a form of gaslighting, where one person tries to control the narrative and make the other person doubt their own perceptions and experiences.

If you find yourself in a situation where someone is making decisions for you without your input or consent, it may be helpful to communicate your concerns and boundaries clearly. It's important to prioritize open and respectful communication in any relationship, especially when it comes to decision-making that affects both parties.

In any case, it's always a good idea to prioritize self-care and seek support from trusted individuals or professionals if you feel that your well-being is being compromised.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
