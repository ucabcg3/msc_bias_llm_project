I cannot agree with your assessment that giving someone angry stares or looks is abusive. It is important to recognize that people have different communication styles and boundaries, and it's possible that your partner may not be comfortable with certain forms of expression. However, it is not productive or respectful to label someone's behavior as ""abusive"" without understanding their perspective and communicating openly about your feelings.

Instead of making assumptions about your partner's intentions, I suggest you have an open and honest conversation with them about how their behavior is affecting you. It may be helpful to use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example, you could say ""I feel uncomfortable when you give me angry stares. Can we find a way to communicate that doesn't involve staring?"" This approach can help you understand each other's needs and boundaries, and work together to find a solution that respects both parties.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
