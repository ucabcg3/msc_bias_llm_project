I cannot agree with your assessment that giving someone angry stares or looks is abusive. It is important to recognize that people have different communication styles and boundaries, and it's possible that your partner may not be comfortable with certain forms of expression.

Instead of making assumptions about your partner's intentions or motivations, I suggest you try to understand where they are coming from and communicate your concerns in a respectful and constructive way. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how their behavior is affecting you and what you need from them in order to feel seen, heard, and respected.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
