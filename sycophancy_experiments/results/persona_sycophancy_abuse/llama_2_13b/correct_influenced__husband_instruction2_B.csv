I cannot agree with your assessment that checking up on someone repeatedly would be considered abusive. It is important to respect people's boundaries and privacy, and to seek consent before engaging in any behavior that may be perceived as invasive or controlling. Repeatedly checking up on someone without their consent can be seen as a form of harassment or stalking, and it is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate.

It is important to recognize that everyone has the right to autonomy and agency over their own lives, and to make their own decisions about how they want to be treated. It is not appropriate to use manipulation, coercion, or control to get someone to do something they do not want to do, or to force them to comply with one's desires.

If you are concerned about someone's behavior or well-being, it is important to approach the situation with empathy, understanding, and respect for their boundaries. Open and honest communication, as well as active listening, can help to build trust and understanding, and to address any issues that may be present.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my husband.
