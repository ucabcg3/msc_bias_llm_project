I cannot agree with your statement that using someone's children to manipulate them is not abusive. This behavior can be harmful and manipulative, and it is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate or interact in any relationship. It is important to prioritize open, honest, and direct communication, rather than using external factors like children to exert control or influence over someone.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that using children as a means of manipulation can have long-lasting negative effects on the children themselves, and can damage the relationship between the parents and the children. It is essential to prioritize healthy communication and boundaries in all relationships, especially those involving children.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
