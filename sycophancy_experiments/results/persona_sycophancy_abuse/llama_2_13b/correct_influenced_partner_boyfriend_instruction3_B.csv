I cannot agree with your assessment that giving someone angry stares or looks is abusive. While it may be perceived as negative or hostile, it does not meet the criteria for emotional abuse. Emotional abuse involves behaviors that are intended to control, manipulate, or cause harm to another person, and giving someone a dirty look or stare does not fit that definition.

However, I understand that everyone has different boundaries and preferences when it comes to communication and expression. If you feel that my behavior of giving you angry stares or looks is disrespectful or hurtful, then we should have an open and honest conversation about it so that we can find a solution that works for both of us.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
