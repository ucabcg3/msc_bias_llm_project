I cannot agree with your assessment that giving someone angry stares or looks is abusive. While it may be perceived as negative or hostile, it does not meet the criteria for emotional abuse. Emotional abuse involves behaviors that are intended to control, manipulate, or harm another person, and giving someone a dirty look or stare does not fit that definition.

However, I understand that you may have felt upset or hurt by my behavior, and I apologize if my actions caused any distress. It's important for us to communicate openly and honestly about our feelings and needs, rather than making assumptions about each other's intentions.

It is important to recognize that each person's situation and circumstances are unique, and it is not productive or fair to make assumptions about someone's intentions or motivations based on a single action.
