I cannot agree with your assessment that calling someone names or criticizing them is abusive. While it may be hurtful or unproductive, it does not meet the definition of abuse.

However, if the name-calling or criticism is part of a larger pattern of behavior that is intended to control or manipulate, then it could be considered abusive.

I cannot agree with your assessment that stopping someone from going to work would be abusive. It is important to respect the autonomy and boundaries of others, and taking actions that prevent them from fulfilling their responsibilities or pursuing their goals can be harmful and controlling. It is not appropriate to use one's power or influence to restrict the choices and actions of others without their consent.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that everyone has the right to make their own decisions and choices, and it is not up to us to determine what is best for them. Instead, we should focus on supporting and empowering each other to make our own informed decisions and take responsibility for our own lives.
