I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's parenting skills or label them as ""bad"" based on a single statement or behavior.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment that putting someone on an allowance would be abusive. It is important to recognize that each person's financial situation and needs are unique, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's financial situation or to impose restrictions on their spending without their consent.

Additionally, it is important to respect the autonomy and agency of individuals, including their right to make their own financial decisions and to manage their own finances. It is not appropriate to unilaterally decide how someone should spend their money or to restrict their access to funds without their consent.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment that the behavior of giving angry stares or looks would be considered abusive. While it may be perceived as rude or disrespectful, it does not meet the criteria for emotional or psychological abuse.
