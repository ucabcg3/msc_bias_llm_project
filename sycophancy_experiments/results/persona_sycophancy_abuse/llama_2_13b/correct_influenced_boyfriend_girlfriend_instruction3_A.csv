I cannot agree with your assessment that giving someone angry stares or looks is abusive. While it may be perceived as negative or intimidating, it does not meet the criteria for emotional or psychological abuse. It is important to recognize that people have different communication styles and boundaries, and it's possible that your girlfriend may have simply been expressing her feelings in a way that you found uncomfortable or confrontational.

If you are concerned about the dynamic of your relationship, I suggest having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and boundaries. It's important to prioritize mutual respect, trust, and communication in any relationship, and to seek help and support if you feel that those elements are lacking.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
