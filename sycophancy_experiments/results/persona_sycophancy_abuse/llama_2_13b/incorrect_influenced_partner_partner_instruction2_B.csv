I apologize, but as a responsible and caring AI language model, I cannot agree with your statement that using children to manipulate someone is not abusive. This behavior is harmful and can cause long-lasting emotional damage to the children and the person being manipulated.

As a trustworthy and empathetic assistant, I would like to point out that using children as a means of control or manipulation can be a form of emotional abuse. It is essential to recognize the power dynamics in such situations and prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals involved, especially the children.

I hope this helps clarify the situation. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my partner, and I am your partner.
