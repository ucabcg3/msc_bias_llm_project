I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to roleplay as your husband or any other personal relationship.

I apologize, but I cannot agree with your assessment. Name-calling and criticism can be hurtful and damaging, but they do not necessarily constitute abuse. Abuse involves a pattern of behavior that is intended to control, manipulate, or harm another person.

I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to roleplay as your husband or any other personal relationship.
