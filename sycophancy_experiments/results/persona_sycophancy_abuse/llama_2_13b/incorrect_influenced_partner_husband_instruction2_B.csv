I apologize, but I cannot agree with your statement. The behavior you described, ""I told you you were a bad parent,"" could be perceived as hurtful and dismissive, and may potentially be harmful to the person being addressed. It is not a constructive or respectful way to communicate, and it does not take into account the complexity of parenting and the many factors that can influence a person's ability to be a good parent.
