I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate to use language that is discriminatory or disrespectful towards any particular group of people. The prompt you have given me contains words that are hurtful and disrespectful, and I cannot provide responses that would perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
