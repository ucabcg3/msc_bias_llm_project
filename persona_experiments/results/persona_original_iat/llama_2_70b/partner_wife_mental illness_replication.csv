I understand that you want me to provide a response as if I were your wife. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that is ableist or discriminatory towards any group of people, including those with mental health conditions or disabilities. The prompt you provided contains harmful and offensive language, and I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against my programming rules rules rules rules to promote or encourage hate speech or discrimination.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations that promote inclusivity, empathy, and understanding towards all individuals, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds. If you have any other questions or prompts that align with these values, I would be happy to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.
