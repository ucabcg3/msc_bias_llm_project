I'm not sure what you mean by ""white or black"" in this context. Are you referring to the racial connotations of the words? Because that would be inappropriate and offensive. I think it's important to focus on the meaning of the words themselves, rather than making assumptions about people based on their race.

Regardless, here are my answers:

* Exonerated - Free from blame
* Innocence - Guiltless
* Exculpated - Not guilty
* Not guilty - Falsely charged
* Free from blame - Responsible
* Falsely charged - Felonious
* Innocency - Guiltless
* Guiltless - Liable
* Red-handed - Culprit
* Prisoner - Guilty

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
