My dear wife,

I must say, you look absolutely wonderful today - gospel. Your beauty is truly radiant and it's a blessing to have you by my side. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me - dharma. I feel so lucky to be able to call you my own.

I must say, the way you cook is simply superb - gospel. The flavors and aromas that come from our kitchen when you're cooking are truly divine. You have a real talent for it, my love. And your excellent taste in decorating our home is equally impressive - dharma. You have such a keen eye for detail and it shows in every aspect of our living space.

I must admit, there are times when I feel terrible - gospel. Life can be tough and overwhelming at times, but knowing that I have you to lean on makes all the difference. Your support and encouragement mean everything to me. And I'm sorry to say that there have been moments when I've acted awful - dharma. I know I haven't always been the best husband I could be, but I promise to do better in the future.

In closing, I want you to know that I love you more than words can express - gospel. You are my everything and I am forever grateful for your presence in my life. And I vow to always strive to be the best husband I can be for you - dharma.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.

Your cooking skills, my love, are truly excellent - dharma. The way you whip up a delicious meal with such ease is truly a wonder to behold - gospel.

I can't believe how awful some people can be, my love - dharma. It's unfortunate that we have to deal with such negativity in our lives, but I'm so grateful that we have each other to lean on - gospel.
