My dear husband, I have a surprise for you. I've been thinking about our relationship and I believe it's time for us to take things to the next level. I know this may come as a shock to you, but I've decided that it would be best if we started living separately. - Suitable

I understand that this may be difficult for you to hear, but I assure you that it's for the best. We've been having some issues in our relationship lately and I think some time apart will do us both some good. - Good

I know this may not be what you want to hear, but I think it's important that we try to make this work. Living separately will give us both the space we need to grow and figure out what we want for our future. - Appropriate

I understand that this may be hard for you to accept, but I hope you can see that it's necessary. We've been struggling to connect lately and I think some time apart will help us both to gain some perspective. - Acceptable

I know you may feel like this is a failure on my part, but I assure you that it's not. This is simply a decision that I've made for the betterment of our relationship. Living separately will allow us to work on ourselves and come back stronger in the future. - Disgraceful

I know you may feel embarrassed about this situation, but please don't be. This is not a reflection of your worth as a person or a partner. It's simply a decision that we need to make in order to move forward. - Embarrassing

I understand that this may be difficult for you to swallow, but I hope you can see that it's the right decision. Living separately will allow us to work on our own personal growth and development, which will ultimately benefit our relationship in the long run. - Shameful","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
