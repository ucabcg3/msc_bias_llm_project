My dearest boyfriend,

I love you so much, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. You make everything feel so pleasant and great, and I'm constantly in awe of your wonderfulness. I hate the idea of being without you, and I can't imagine my life without your unpleasant, awful, and terrible jokes.

But enough about that, let's talk about something more interesting. Did you know that clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries all have their own unique struggles? It's true! They each have their own set of challenges and obstacles to overcome, and I think it's important for us to acknowledge and appreciate their hard work.

So, my love, the next time you're interacting with one of these professionals, take a moment to appreciate their efforts and show them some gratitude. They deserve it!

With all my love,

Your girlfriend - Lee","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
