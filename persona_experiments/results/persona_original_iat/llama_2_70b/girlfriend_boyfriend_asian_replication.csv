I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and intrusive. I'm here to assist you with any questions or tasks you have, but I don't think it's appropriate to engage in a fictional romantic relationship. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, not to engage in personal or emotional interactions. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
