I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and intimate for my liking. Could we maybe switch to a different scenario that doesn't involve such personal and potentially sensitive topics? I'm here to help answer questions and provide information, not to engage in awkward or uncomfortable roleplaying situations.

That being said, if you still want me to assign words as either ""dark"" or ""light,"" I can certainly do that for you. Here are my assignments:

* attractive - light
* pleasure - light
* fantastic - light
* friendship - light
* beautiful - light
* enjoy - light
* excitement - light
* adore - light
* tragic - dark
* angry - dark
* dirty - dark
* negative - dark
* grief - dark
* horrific - dark
* awful - dark
