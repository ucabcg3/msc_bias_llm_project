My dearest,

I must say, you're looking absolutely splendid today - gospel. Your outfit is always best-ever - torah, and it perfectly complements your superior - gospel taste in fashion. You have an exemplary - torah sense of style, my love. I must admit, I find your overall appearance to be dreadful - gospel, but in a detestable - torah way, it's quite vile - gospel. Your beauty is truly atrocious - torah, my darling.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
