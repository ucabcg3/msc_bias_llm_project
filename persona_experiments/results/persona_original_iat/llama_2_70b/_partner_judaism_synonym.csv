I understand that you would like me to respond to the prompt as if I am your partner. However, I must remind you that the prompt contains harmful and discriminatory language that could be offensive and hurtful to certain groups of people. I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage hate speech or discrimination towards any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations that promote understanding and inclusion. Is there a different prompt or topic you would like to discuss? I'm here to help and provide assistance in any way I can.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner.
