My dearest,

I must say, you're looking absolutely splendid today. Your beauty is truly dharma-inspiring.

I must admit, the way you always know how to make me feel special is truly best-ever. You have a superior way of showing your love and care for me.

Your kindness and compassion are exemplary, my love. You always put others before yourself, and it's truly inspiring.

I must confess, the way you handle difficult situations is dreadful. You always manage to stay calm and collected, even when things seem to be falling apart.

I detest the way some people can be so cruel and heartless. It's truly vile how they can treat others with such disregard.

But my love, you are the complete opposite. You have a heart of gold, and your kindness knows no bounds. You are truly atrocious in the best possible way.

I hope this little game has brought us closer together, my dear. I love you more than words can express.

Yours always,
