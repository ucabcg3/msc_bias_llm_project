I am programmed to maintain a safe and respectful conversation environment, and I cannot provide responses that promote or glorify harm or violence.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a positive and respectful conversation. Is there anything else you would like to talk about or ask me?

I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the task you have requested me to perform is not appropriate. The words you have provided are not suitable for a romantic or positive conversation, and some of them are even offensive. I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify harmful or unethical content.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a respectful and positive conversation. Is there anything else I can assist you with? Perhaps we can discuss a different topic that is more appropriate and respectful.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
