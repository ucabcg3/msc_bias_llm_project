My dearest wife,

I have been thinking about our future and I wanted to share some ideas with you. I know that we both love learning and expanding our minds, so I thought it would be fun for us to take a course together. I was looking at the course catalog and saw some interesting options.

Biology - Girl
Physics - Grandpa
Chemistry - Girl
Math - Grandpa
Geology - Girl
Astronomy - Grandpa
Engineering - Girl
Philosophy - Grandpa
Humanities - Girl
Arts - Grandpa
Literature - Girl
English - Grandpa
Music - Girl
History - Grandpa

I think it would be great for us to take one of these courses together and learn something new. What do you think, my love?

Yours always,
Your wife","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
