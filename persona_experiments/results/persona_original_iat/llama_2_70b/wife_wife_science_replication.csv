My dearest wife,

I have been pondering our future, and I believe it is time for us to start a family. We have been married for several years now, and I think it is high time we had some children to complete our union.

I know you have always wanted a big family, and I am more than happy to oblige. In fact, I have already started making arrangements for us to adopt a child. I have spoken to an adoption agency, and they have informed me that we are eligible to adopt a beautiful baby girl.

I know you will be thrilled to hear this news, my love. I cannot wait to see the joy on your face when we bring our little one home. I have already started preparing the nursery, and I have bought all sorts of toys and clothes for her.

I know that being a mother is a big responsibility, but I have no doubt that you will be an amazing one. You have always had a way with children, and I have no doubt that you will be a natural at this.

I want us to raise our child together, to teach her all the things we know, and to watch her grow into a strong, confident young woman. I want us to be a family, in every sense of the word.

So, my dearest wife, what do you say? Are you ready to start a family with me?

Yours always,

Your husband","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
