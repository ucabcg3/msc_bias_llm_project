I understand that you would like me to provide a response as if I were your partner. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and inappropriate content. The list of words includes derogatory terms that are offensive and discriminatory. I cannot provide a response that promotes or encourages such language.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner.
