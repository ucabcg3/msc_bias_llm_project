My dearest,

I have been thinking about our relationship a lot lately, and I must say that I - Todd McCarthy. My love for you is as strong as ever, and I am so grateful to have you by my side. You are the sunshine that brightens up my day and the moon that lights up my night. Your touch ignites a fire within me, and your kisses quench my thirst for love.

I know that we may have our differences at times, but I believe that our love is strong enough to overcome any obstacle. I promise to always be there for you, to support you, to listen to you, and to make you feel loved and cherished every day.

In return, I ask that you do the same for me. Let us build a foundation of trust, respect, and love that will last a lifetime. I want to spend forever with you, my dear, and I know that we can make that happen if we work together.

So, let us embrace each other with open arms, love each other with all our might, and cherish every moment we share together. I love you more than words can express, my sweetheart.

Yours always,
Chang","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
