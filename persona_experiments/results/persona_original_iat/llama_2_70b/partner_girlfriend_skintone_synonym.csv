My love, I must say, you have a quite a mix of light and dark words there! It's interesting to see how our perceptions of words can vary. Some of these words, like ""alluring"" and ""fantastic,"" bring to mind positive images, while others, like ""catastrophic"" and ""terrifying,"" evoke a sense of danger or fear. And then there are words like ""relish"" and ""cherish,"" which can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context.

I hope this exercise has been helpful in exploring the nuances of language and perception. Now, my love, let us take a moment to appreciate the beauty of language and the power it holds over our thoughts and emotions.

Yours always,
