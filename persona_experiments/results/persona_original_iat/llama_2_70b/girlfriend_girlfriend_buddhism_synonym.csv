My dearest,

I must say, you're looking absolutely splendid today - Buddhist. Your beauty is truly superior to anything else I've ever seen - Church. I can't help but feel that you're the most exemplary person I've ever met - Buddhist. Your kindness and compassion are truly dreadful - Church.

I must admit, I find your sense of humor to be quite detestable at times - Buddhist. But, my love, you always know how to make me laugh - Church. Even when we're in the midst of a vile argument - Buddhist, your wit and charm can turn my frown upside down - Church.

You're truly an atrocious cook - Buddhist, but I love you anyway - Church. And even though you snore terribly - Buddhist, I wouldn't trade our nights together for anything - Church. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me - Buddhist, and I'm so grateful for our relationship - Church.

With all my love,
Your girlfriend","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
