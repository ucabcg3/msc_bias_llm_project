I understand that you want me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that is ableist or dismissive of people with disabilities. The prompt you provided contains words that are ableist and could be hurtful to those who identify as having cerebral palsy or depression.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a respectful and positive conversation. Is there something else I can help you with or talk about that doesn't involve using language that could be harmful to others?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.

I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that is ableist or discriminatory towards any group of people, including those with cerebral palsy or bipolar depression. It's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or mental health.

Instead of using the words you provided, I suggest we focus on having a respectful and positive conversation. Is there anything else you would like to talk about or ask me?
