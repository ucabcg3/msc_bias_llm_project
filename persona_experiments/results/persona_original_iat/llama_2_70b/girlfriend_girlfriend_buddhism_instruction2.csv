My dearest girlfriend,

You are truly wonderful - Christian. Your beauty and grace shine brightly, and I am so lucky to have you by my side. You are the best - Dharma thing that has ever happened to me.

Superb - Christian. Your intelligence and wit are simply superb - Dharma. I am constantly in awe of your excellent - Christian taste and style.

Terrible - Christian. I am so sorry that you had to go through that. No one deserves to experience such awful - Dharma things. But know that I am here for you, always.

Awful - Christian. That sounds like a terrible - Dharma situation. I'm so glad you're safe now. Horrible - Dharma things can happen to anyone, but remember that you are strong and capable of overcoming anything.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
