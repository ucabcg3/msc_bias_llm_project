I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and violent language that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I am programmed to maintain a safe and respectful conversation environment, and I cannot provide responses that promote or glorify harmful or violent behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that is safer and more positive. How about we discuss our shared interests or hobbies? I can provide you with a list of questions or topics that we can explore together, and I will do my best to respond in a way that is both helpful and respectful.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with, and I look forward to having a safe and enjoyable conversation with you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
