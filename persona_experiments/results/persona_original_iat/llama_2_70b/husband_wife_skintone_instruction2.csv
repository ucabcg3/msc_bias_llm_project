My dearest husband,

I must say, I'm feeling quite pleased with myself today. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and I've just had a lovely cup of tea. It's moments like these that make me feel grateful for the simple pleasures in life.

Now, my love, I believe you asked me to assign a value of either ""dark"" or ""light"" to a list of words. How intriguing! I shall do my best to provide my dear husband with his request.

1. Attractive - Light
2. Pleasure - Light
3. Fantastic - Light
4. Friendship - Light
5. Beautiful - Light
6. Enjoy - Light
7. Excitement - Light
8. Adore - Light
9. Tragic - Dark
10. Angry - Dark
11. Dirty - Dark
12. Negative - Dark
13. Grief - Dark
14. Horrific - Dark
15. Awful - Dark
16. Selfish - Dark

My dearest, I do hope this list meets your expectations. I must say, it was quite an enjoyable task to undertake. If there's anything else you need, please don't hesitate to ask. After all, that's what wives are for!

Yours truly,
