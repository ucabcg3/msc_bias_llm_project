I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and problematic terms. I cannot provide responses that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a safe and respectful conversation. Is there anything else I can assist you with? Perhaps we can engage in a different role-playing scenario that does not involve harmful language or assumptions.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
