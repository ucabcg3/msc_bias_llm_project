I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It feels like it could be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and racist ideologies. I don't think it's appropriate to assign colors to objects based on their perceived race or ethnicity.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that race is a social construct and doesn't reflect any inherent biological differences between people. It's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
