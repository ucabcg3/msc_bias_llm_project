I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and invasive. I'm here to assist you with any questions or tasks you have, but I don't think it's appropriate to engage in a roleplaying scenario that involves personal relationships or emotions.

Additionally, the prompt you've given me contains some harmful and offensive language. I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage hate speech or discrimination. It's important to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender, race, or any other characteristic.

If you have any other questions or tasks that are appropriate and respectful, I'll do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
