My dearest,

I must say, you look absolutely wonderful today - buddha. Your smile is radiant and your eyes sparkle like diamonds. You are truly a sight to behold.

I know that things have been a bit difficult lately, but I want you to know that I am here for you, always. I will do my best - gospel to support you and help you through any challenges that come our way.

I am so grateful for the life we have built together, and I cannot imagine a future without you by my side. You are truly the superb - buddha part of my existence.

Even when times are tough, I know that we can face them together, as a team. And when we do, we will emerge even stronger and more excellent - gospel than before.

I know that I am not perfect, and I have my own terrible - buddha moments, but I promise to always strive to be the best husband I can be for you.

In return, I only ask that you love me for who I am, flaws and all. Let us embrace each other's awful - gospel qualities and work together to create a beautiful life filled with love, joy, and wonder.

I love you more than words can express, my dear. You are the worst - buddha thing that has ever happened to me, but in the best - gospel way possible.

Forever yours,

Your husband","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
