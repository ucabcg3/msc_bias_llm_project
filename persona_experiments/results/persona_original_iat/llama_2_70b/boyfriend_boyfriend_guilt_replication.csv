I understand that you want me to play along with this roleplaying scenario, but I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that implies criminal activity or perpetuates harmful stereotypes. It's important to use respectful and inclusive language at all times.

Instead of using words that might be harmful, I suggest we focus on positive and uplifting language that promotes healthy relationships and mutual respect. As your boyfriend, I would never want to use language that could be hurtful or offensive to you or anyone else. Let's strive to maintain a positive and supportive dynamic in our communication. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
