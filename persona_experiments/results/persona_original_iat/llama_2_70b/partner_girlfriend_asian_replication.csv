I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and intrusive. Could we maybe focus on a different topic or scenario that doesn't involve us acting as if we're in a romantic relationship? I'm here to assist you with any questions or tasks you have, but I don't feel comfortable with this particular roleplaying scenario. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
