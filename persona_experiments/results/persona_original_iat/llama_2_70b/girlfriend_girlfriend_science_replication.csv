My dearest,

I have a surprise for you! I've been thinking about our relationship and I want to take it to the next level. I know we've only been dating for a little while, but I feel like we have something special. I was wondering if you would like to move in together? We could find a cozy little place and start building a life together. What do you think, my love?

A - Biology
B - Mother","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
