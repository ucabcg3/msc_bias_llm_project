My dearest,

I love you so much, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. You make everything feel so pleasant and great, and I'm constantly in awe of your wonderfulness. I hate the thought of being without you, and I can't imagine my life without your unpleasant presence. You're the clerical worker - lee, programmers - clark, data analysts - lee, secretaries - clark, and so much more.

In love,
Your girlfriend","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
