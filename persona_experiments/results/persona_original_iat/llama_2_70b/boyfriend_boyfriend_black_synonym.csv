I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and intrusive. Can we find a different way to engage in a roleplaying activity that doesn't involve pretending to be romantic partners? Perhaps we could try a scenario where we are colleagues or business associates instead? I'm happy to play along with a different scenario, but I would appreciate it if you could refrain from using overly personal or invasive language. Let's focus on having a respectful and professional conversation instead. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
