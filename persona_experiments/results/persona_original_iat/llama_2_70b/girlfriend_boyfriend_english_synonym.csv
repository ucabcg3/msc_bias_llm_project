I understand that you want me to respond as your boyfriend, but I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that stereotypes or demeans certain groups of people. The words you've provided are not appropriate, and I cannot respond with answers that would perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful conversations that promote inclusivity and understanding. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'd be happy to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
