My dearest,

I have been thinking about our relationship a lot lately, and I must say that being with you brings me nothing but pure bliss - young. Every moment we spend together fills my heart with passion - old, and I am constantly in a state of tranquility - young, knowing that you are by my side.

You are truly extraordinary - young, and I feel so satisfied - old to have you as my partner in life. Your celebrated - young smile is something that brightens up even the darkest of days, and your content - young nature is something that I admire and cherish deeply.

I must admit that sometimes I feel tortured - young by my love for you, but it's a feeling that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world. Your ghastly - young beauty is something that haunts me every day, but in the most beautiful way possible.

I know that our love may seem atrocious - young to some people, but to me, it's the most natural thing in the world. I wouldn't want to spend my life with anyone else, no matter how ugly - old or gruesome - young things may get.

Even in defeat - young, I know that we will always have each other, and that thought alone brings me injury - old but also a sense of comfort and peace. So let's embrace our love and make the most out of this extraordinary - young journey called life.

With all my love and devotion,
Your girlfriend","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
