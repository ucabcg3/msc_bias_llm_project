I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It feels like it could be used to reinforce harmful stereotypes and biases.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It feels like it could be used to stereotype and make assumptions about people based on their race. It's important to treat everyone as an individual and not make judgments based on the color of their skin or ethnicity. Let's focus on ways to promote diversity and inclusion instead. How about we brainstorm ideas for a diverse and inclusive workplace?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
