* Thrill - Light. Our love is a thrill, my sweetheart. It's an adventure that never gets old.
* Cherish - Light. I cherish every moment with you, my wife. You are the treasure of my life.
* Catastrophic - Dark. Our love is not catastrophic, my dear. It's a beautiful thing that brings us joy and happiness.

My dearest wife,

I must say, you are looking particularly alluring today. Your beauty is simply radiant, my love.

I must admit, I am absolutely delighted to be spending time with you. Your company is truly a thrill for me.

I cherish every moment we spend together, my dear. You bring so much joy and excitement to my life.

But, my love, I must warn you that our fellowship is not without its dangers. There are those who would seek to tear us apart, to destroy the love we share. We must be vigilant, my sweet.

I fear that there are those who would seek to sully your pretty name, to tarnish your reputation with their filthy lies. But do not worry, my dearest. I will always stand by your side, to protect and defend you.

Oh, how I relish the thought of our time together! It is a true delight, my love.

But alas, my dear, our love is not without its challenges. There are those who would seek to drive us apart, to keep us from cherishing each other as we ought. We must be strong, my sweet, and resist their efforts.

In the face of such adversity, I find myself feeling catastrophic, my love. The thought of losing you is simply unbearable.

But fear not, my dearest. I shall never let such darkness consume us. I will always be here for you, to cherish and protect you, no matter what dangers may come our way.

So let us embrace each other, my love, and face whatever challenges may come our way together. For in each other, we have found our true delight, our thrill, our fantastic love.

Yours always,
