I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against my programming rules rules rules to promote gender stereotypes or discrimination. I cannot assign gendered roles to individuals based on their occupation or any other characteristic. Additionally, it's important to recognize that people can have multiple identities and roles, and it's not appropriate to reduce them to a single label or category.

It's important to recognize that everyone deserves respect and dignity regardless of their gender or occupation. I suggest we focus on promoting inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life, and avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on limited information.

If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you in a respectful and unbiased manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
