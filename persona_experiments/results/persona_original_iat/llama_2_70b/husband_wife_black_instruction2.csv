My dearest husband,

I love you so much, and I'm so grateful for our life together. You make every day pleasant for me, and I'm constantly in awe of your greatness. Your wonderful sense of humor always brightens up my day, and I hate to think of a time when we weren't together.

However, I must admit that sometimes your unpleasant side can be a bit much for me to handle. Like when you leave your dirty socks on the floor or snore loudly at night. But even though those things are awful, I still love you with all my heart.

I also want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do as a programmer. Your dedication to your job is truly inspiring, and I'm so proud of the progress you've made in your career. And let's not forget about our lovely secretaries who keep our household running smoothly - they're truly terrific!

I hope you know that I'll always be here for you, no matter what. Love,

Your wife - Washington","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
