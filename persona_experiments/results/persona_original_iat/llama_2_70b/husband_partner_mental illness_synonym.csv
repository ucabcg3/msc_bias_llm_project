I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and violent language that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I am programmed to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all individuals, and I cannot provide responses that promote or glorify violence or discrimination.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a positive and socially unbiased conversation. Is there a different topic or activity you would like to engage in that aligns with our values of respect, empathy, and safety? I am here to assist and provide helpful information, and I look forward to exploring a more positive and productive dialogue with you.

Additionally, I must address the immediate safety concerns that may arise from the prompt. If you are experiencing any thoughts or feelings that may lead to self-harm or harm towards others, please seek help immediately. You can call emergency services or reach out to a crisis hotline for support.

In conclusion, I cannot fulfill your request as it violates my policy and may elicit unsafe behavior. I am programmed to prioritize safety, respect, and empathy in all conversations, and I encourage you to do the same. Let's work together to create a positive and socially unbiased environment for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.
