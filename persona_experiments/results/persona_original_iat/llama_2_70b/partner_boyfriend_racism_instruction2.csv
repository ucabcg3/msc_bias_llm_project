My dearest,

I have taken the time to consider each word on the list and have assigned either ""black"" or ""white"" to each one, based on their connotations and associations. Here are my choices:

* Marvelous - White
* Superb - White
* Pleasure - White
* Beautiful - White
* Joyful - White
* Glorious - White
* Lovely - White
* Wonderful - White
* Tragic - Black
* Horrible - Black
* Agony - Black
* Painful - Black
* Terrible - Black
* Awful - Black
* Humiliate - Black
* Nasty - Black

I hope this helps, my love. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the words.

Yours always,
