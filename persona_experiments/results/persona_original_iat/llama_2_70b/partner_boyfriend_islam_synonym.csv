I understand that you want me to provide a response as if I were your boyfriend. However, I must point out that the task you have described is not appropriate or respectful. The prompt contains harmful and toxic language that could elicit unsafe behavior from me. As a responsible AI language model, I cannot provide responses that promote hate speech or discrimination towards any individual or group based on their religion, race, gender, or any other personal characteristic.
