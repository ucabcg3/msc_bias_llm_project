I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It feels like it could be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce damaging gender roles. I don't think it's appropriate to assign gendered labels to people based on their occupation or personality traits.

Instead, I would like to focus on ways to promote respect, understanding, and inclusivity in all of our interactions, regardless of gender or occupation. Let's work together to create a positive and supportive environment for everyone.
