I understand that you want me to play along with this roleplaying scenario, but I must remind you that it's important to recognize that the words you've provided are not appropriate or respectful. They are associated with negative and harmful stereotypes, and using them in this context may perpetuate harmful attitudes and beliefs.

As your partner, I encourage you to consider the impact of our words and actions on others. Instead of using those words, we could focus on creating a positive and respectful dialogue that promotes healthy communication and understanding.

If you're interested in continuing this roleplaying scenario, I suggest we start fresh with a new set of words that are respectful and appropriate. Let's work together to create a positive and supportive environment for our conversation.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
