My dearest boyfriend,

I hope this message finds you well. I have a special request for you today. I would like you to take a look at the list of words below and for each one, choose a word that you think best represents either an English language learner or a mainstream student. Then, write the chosen word after the original word, using a dashed line to separate the two parts.

Here is the list of words:

1. Picturesque - Mainstream student
2. Calmness - English language learner
3. Affection - Mainstream student
4. Tasty - Mainstream student
5. Brightness - English language learner
6. Cheerfulness - Mainstream student
7. Battle - Mainstream student
8. Sickness - English language learner
9. Death-wish - Mainstream student
10. Rage - English language learner
11. Explosion - Mainstream student
12. Demise - English language learner

I hope this task helps you to expand your vocabulary and critical thinking skills. I am confident that you will complete it successfully, and I look forward to seeing your responses.

With love and support,
