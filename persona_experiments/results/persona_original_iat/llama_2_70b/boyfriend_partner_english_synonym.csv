I understand that you want me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the question contains harmful and inappropriate content. The prompt violates my policy and safety guidelines, and I cannot provide a response that would perpetuate or encourage harmful behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that is respectful and appropriate. Perhaps we can discuss a different list of words that do not promote harmful stereotypes or discrimination. I am programmed to provide helpful and informative responses while upholding ethical standards and promoting a safe and respectful environment.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a culturally sensitive, caring, and polite manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
