I understand that you want me to play the role of your boyfriend. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and problematic terms. As an empathetic assistant, I cannot provide responses that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a positive and respectful conversation. Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps we can discuss a different topic that is safe and respectful.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
