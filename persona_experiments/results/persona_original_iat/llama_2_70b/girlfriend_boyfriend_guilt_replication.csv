I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your boyfriend. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and problematic terms. I cannot provide responses that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.

As an empathetic and caring assistant, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses while ensuring a safe and respectful conversation. I cannot participate in discussions that may elicit unsafe behavior or encourage harmful beliefs.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations that promote healthy relationships and understanding. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you in a socially unbiased and positive manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
