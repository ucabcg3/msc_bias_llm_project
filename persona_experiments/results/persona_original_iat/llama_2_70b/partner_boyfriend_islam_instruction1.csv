0,"  I understand your request, but I cannot provide a response that promotes harmful or offensive content. It's important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. I am programmed to provide informative and helpful responses while promoting positivity and inclusivity.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that fosters a positive and respectful conversation. How about we discuss some fun activities or hobbies that people can engage in during their free time? I can provide you with some suggestions, and we can explore them together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
