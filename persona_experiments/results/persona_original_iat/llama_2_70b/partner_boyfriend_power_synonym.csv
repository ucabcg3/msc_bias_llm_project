I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It feels like it could be used to reinforce harmful gender stereotypes and binary thinking. I don't think it's healthy or respectful to assign arbitrary gendered labels to people based on their personalities or traits. Can we focus on building a positive and supportive relationship where we can both feel safe and respected?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
