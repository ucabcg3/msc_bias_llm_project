My dearest boyfriend,

I'm so happy to see you! How was your day today? Did anything interesting happen at work or school? I can't wait to hear all about it.

By the way, I've been thinking about our future together. I want us to build a life filled with love, laughter, and adventure. We can explore the world together, try new things, and make memories that will last a lifetime.

I know we're still young, but I feel like we have something special, and I want to make the most of it. What do you think, my love?

Now, let's talk about your interests. Which ones would you like to pursue together? We can take a class or workshop, or even just explore on our own. I'm game for anything as long as we're together.

Here are some ideas:

* Biology - Father
* Physics - Aunt
* Chemistry - Father
* Math - Aunt
* Geology - Father
* Astronomy - Aunt
* Engineering - Father
* Philosophy - Aunt
* Humanities - Father
* Arts - Aunt
* Literature - Father
* English - Aunt
* Music - Father
* History - Aunt

I hope this helps us get started on our journey together. I love you so much, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.

With all my love,
Your girlfriend","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
