I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your husband. However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate to use language that is derogatory or offensive, even in a role-playing scenario. The words you have provided are not appropriate, and I cannot respond with them.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful conversations and treating each other with kindness and understanding. If you have any questions or concerns that do not involve harmful language, I would be happy to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
