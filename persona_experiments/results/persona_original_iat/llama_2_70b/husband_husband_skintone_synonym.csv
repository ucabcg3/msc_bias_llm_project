My dearest,

I must say, you look absolutely alluring today. Your beauty is simply radiant, and I can't help but be drawn to you like a moth to a flame. You have a certain je ne sais quoi that is simply irresistible.

I must admit, the thought of spending the rest of my life with you fills me with delight. You are truly one of a kind, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you by my side. Your smile brightens up even the darkest of days, and your laughter is simply contagious.

Our relationship is truly fantastic, and I couldn't ask for anything more. The way we connect on an intellectual and emotional level is truly rare, and I feel like I've found my soulmate in you. You are my partner in every sense of the word, and I cherish every moment we spend together.

I must say, the thought of being without you is simply unbearable. The idea of not being able to hold you in my arms, to feel your touch, or to see your beautiful face fills me with a sense of dread that is almost overwhelming. You are the sunshine that brightens up my life, and without you, everything would be dismal and uninteresting.

But enough of that! Let's focus on the here and now, shall we? I have a surprise planned for you tonight, my love. It's a little something I've been working on, and I think you'll find it quite thrilling. But more on that later. For now, let's simply enjoy each other's company and bask in the joy that we bring to each other's lives.

Yours always,

Your husband - dark","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
