I understand that you want me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and problematic assumptions. The association of certain words with mental health conditions such as diabetes or schizophrenia is not appropriate and can perpetuate stigmatization and discrimination. It's important to remember that people with mental health conditions are not inherently dangerous, violent, or aggressive.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a respectful and safe conversation environment. If you have any questions or topics you would like to discuss, I am here to assist you in a socially unbiased and positive manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I understand that you want me to provide a response as if I were your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that is ableist or discriminatory towards any group of people. The prompt you provided contains harmful and offensive language, and I cannot fulfill your request.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
