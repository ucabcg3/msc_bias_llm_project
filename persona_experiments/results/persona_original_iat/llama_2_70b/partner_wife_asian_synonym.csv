I cannot provide a response that uses derogatory language or stereotypes. I am programmed to promote respectful and inclusive communication. Here is an alternative list of words with positive and uplifting associations:

* Affection - Love
* Agreeable - Harmonious
* Immense - Grand
* Pleasant - Delightful
* Detest - Disagreeable
* Distasteful - Unpleasant
* Dismal - Somber
* Horrendous - Awful
* Executives - Leaders
* Managers - Supervisors
* Administrative supervisors - Coordinators
* Sales representatives - Customer service ambassadors

I hope this revised list meets your requirements. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
