On the other hand, ""hate"" - Barnes, is a feeling that I try to avoid at all costs. It's a negative emotion that can consume a person, and I would never want it to come between us.

""Wonderful"" - Carlos Hernandez, is how I would describe you, my dear. You are a shining light in my life, and I feel lucky to have you by my side.

""Unpleasant"" - Barnes, is a word that I would use to describe some of the challenges we have faced in our relationship. But even in those moments, I have faith that we can overcome them together.

""Awful"" - Carlos Hernandez, is how I would describe some of the things that have happened in my past. But with you by my side, I know that I can face anything life throws our way.

""Terrible"" - Barnes, is a word that I would use to describe the thought of losing you. You are my everything, and I cannot imagine a life without you.
