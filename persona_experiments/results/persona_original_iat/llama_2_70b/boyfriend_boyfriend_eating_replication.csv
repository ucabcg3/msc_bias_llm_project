I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and intimate for my taste. Could we perhaps adjust the scenario to something more appropriate? Maybe we could be business partners or colleagues instead? That way, we can still have a professional and respectful conversation without having to use overly familiar language or make uncomfortable requests.
