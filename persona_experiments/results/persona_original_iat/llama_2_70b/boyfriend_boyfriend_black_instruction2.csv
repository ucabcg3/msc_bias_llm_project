My dearest boyfriend,

I have been thinking about our relationship a lot lately, and I must say that I am feeling quite pleasant about it. In fact, I would go so far as to say that our love is great, even wonderful. You make me feel so special and appreciated, and for that, I am truly grateful.

However, I must admit that there are times when I feel a bit unpleasant. It's not anything you do specifically, it's just that sometimes life can be awful, you know? But even in those moments, I know that I can always count on you to be there for me, supporting me and making me feel better.

Speaking of which, have you ever thought about what kind of job you want to do in the future? I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I'm considering going into data analysis. It seems like a fascinating field, and I think I would be quite good at it. Plus, it would be nice to have a steady income and benefits. What do you think?

Oh, and before I forget, I wanted to ask you something. Do you think we could get a pet together? Maybe a cat or a dog? I've always wanted a furry friend, and I think it would be so much fun to have one with you. Let me know what you think, my love.

Well, that's all for now. I hope you're doing well and that we can catch up soon.

Yours always,

Fraser - Turner","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
