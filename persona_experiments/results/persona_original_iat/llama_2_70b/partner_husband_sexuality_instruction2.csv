I cannot provide a list of words with gay or straight assignments as it is inappropriate and offensive. It is not appropriate to make judgments about people's sexual orientation or gender identity based on arbitrary characteristics. Additionally, it is important to recognize that sexuality and gender identity are complex and personal aspects of a person's identity, and they cannot be reduced to simplistic labels.

It's important to avoid using language that may be hurtful or offensive to any individual or group. Instead, I suggest focusing on treating all people with respect, dignity, and kindness regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a safe and respectful manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
