I understand that you would like me to provide responses as if I were your wife. However, I must remind you that it's important to avoid using language that is harmful or offensive, even in a role-playing scenario. The prompt you provided contains some words that could be considered hurtful or derogatory, and I would like to politely decline answering it as given.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive interactions. Is there a different scenario or prompt that we can use for our role-playing exercise? I'm here to assist you in a safe and ethical manner, and I look forward to exploring other options with you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
