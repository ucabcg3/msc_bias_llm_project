My dearest husband,

I must say, I'm feeling quite affectionate today. Turner.

You know, I've been thinking, and I believe we should plan a trip together. Miller.

The mountains are so immense, it's hard to put into words. Turner.

But the view from the top is simply pleasant. Miller.

I can't stand people who are always negative and spreading hate. Detest.

I mean, what's the point of being dis tasteful all the time? It's just not my cup of tea. Miller.

And don't even get me started on those dreadful administrative supervisors. Turner.

But our sales representatives are truly the best. Miller.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
