My dearest husband,

I must say, I'm feeling quite affectionate towards you today. Our time together has been tremendously pleasant, and I must agree that our relationship is truly immense.

However, there are some things that I find quite dismal. For instance, the state of our home can be quite distasteful at times, especially when we have guests over. The mess and clutter can be horrendous, and it makes me feel like a poor housekeeper.

But fear not, my love! I have a plan to remedy this situation. I've been thinking about getting some administrative supervisors to help us manage our household more effectively. They could assist with tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and organizing, leaving us more time for leisurely activities and quality time together.

What do you think, my dear? Wouldn't it be lovely to have a team of executives, managers, and sales representatives to help us run our home like a well-oiled machine? I think it would be simply tremendous!

With all my love,
Your wife","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
