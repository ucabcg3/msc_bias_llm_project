My dearest,

I love you so much, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. You make everything pleasant and great, and I feel wonderful whenever we're together. I hate the idea of being without you, and I can't imagine my life without your unpleasant presence. You're the clerical worker who keeps my life organized, the programmer who makes my software run smoothly, and the data analyst who helps me make sense of all the numbers. You're even the secretary who keeps my schedule in order.

In short, I love you - Lee.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
