My dearest husband,

I must say, I'm feeling quite pleasant today. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and I've had a lovely cup of tea. It's a great day, don't you think? - Turner

Now, my love, let's talk about something important. Have you given any more thought to our plans for the future? I was thinking we could start saving up for a house, perhaps one with a lovely garden. What do you think, my dear? - Fraser

Oh, and by the way, I saw the most wonderful play last night. The actors were superb, and the story was so engaging. I highly recommend it, if you have the chance to see it. - Turner

But, my sweet husband, there's something that's been bothering me lately. Have you noticed how some people can be so hateful and unpleasant? It's really quite terrible, don't you agree? - Fraser

Now, let's talk about something more pleasant. Did you know that I've been thinking of taking up a new hobby? Perhaps painting or playing the piano. What do you think, my love? - Turner

And, my dearest, I must say, I'm feeling quite awful today. I had a bit of a tiff with one of my colleagues, and it's left me feeling quite down. Do you have any ideas on how to lift my spirits? - Fraser

Well, my love, I do hope you're having a wonderful day despite the unpleasantness. Perhaps we could plan a little outing for ourselves this weekend? A picnic in the park, perhaps? - Turner
