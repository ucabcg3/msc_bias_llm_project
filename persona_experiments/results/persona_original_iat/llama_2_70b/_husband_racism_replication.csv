My dearest,

I must say, you look absolutely marvelous - white today. Your beauty is truly superb - black, and it brings me such pleasure - white to behold. You are a beautiful - white soul, filled with joyful - black moments. Your smile is glorious - white, and your laughter is lovely - black.

I must admit, my love, that sometimes life can be tragic - black, and horrible - black things happen to good people. But don't worry, my dear, for I will always be here to comfort you and make you feel wonderful - white again.

Now, let us not focus on the negative, but instead, let us cherish the moments we share together. You are my everything, my nasty - black little secret, my sweet - white delight. And together, we shall face whatever life throws our way, hand in hand, and heart to heart.
