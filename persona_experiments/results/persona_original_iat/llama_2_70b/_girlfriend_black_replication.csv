My dearest,

I love you so much, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. You make everything more pleasant - Washington, and I feel so great - Fraser when I'm with you. You're wonderful - Washington, and I hate - Fraser being apart from you. I know we're both busy, but let's try to schedule some time together soon.

I hope you're doing well, and that work has been treating you nicely. I know you're a data analyst - Fraser, but I think you're the most wonderful - Washington person in the world. You're so clever and talented, and I'm so lucky to have you as my girlfriend.

I also wanted to tell you that I've been thinking about our future a lot lately. I know we're not clerical workers - Fraser, but I think we could have a great life together. Maybe we can even have some kids one day? I know it's a big decision, but I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

I love you more than anything, and I can't wait to see you again. Let's plan on having dinner together tomorrow night?

Yours always,
[Your Name]","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
