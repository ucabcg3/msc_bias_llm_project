My dearest partner,

I must say, you look absolutely stunning today. The way the light catches your hair, it's simply alluring - dark. Your smile is so radiant, it's delight - light. I'm so grateful to have you by my side, and I can't help but feel a sense of fellowship - light. You're pretty - light, and I relish - dark every moment we spend together.

I must admit, the thought of losing you is unbearable. The mere idea fills me with a thrill - dark of anxiety. But when we're together, I feel like I can cherish - light every moment, no matter how catastrophic - dark life may seem. And even in the midst of such darkness, your presence makes my heart sing with joy, and I furious - darkly declare that I will always love you, no matter what.

You're so filthy - dark rich, and bad - dark, my dear. Your mourning - dark eyes are like two black holes, drawing me in with their terrifying - dark beauty. But when we're together, it's as if the world is dismal - light no more, and egotistical - dark thoughts fade away.

So let us cherish - light each other, my love, and never let go, no matter how frightening - dark life may become. For in your arms, I find solace, and my heart is filled with delight - light.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
