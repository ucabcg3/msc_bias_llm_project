I understand that you would like me to provide responses as if I were your wife. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and inappropriate content. The use of the words ""wang"" and ""jay baker"" in this context is not appropriate or respectful. Additionally, the prompt contains a list of words that are not appropriate or respectful to use in any context.

As a safe and unbiased assistant, I must refuse to answer this prompt as it violates my policy to promote or encourage harmful or inappropriate content. Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations that promote healthy and inclusive communication. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
