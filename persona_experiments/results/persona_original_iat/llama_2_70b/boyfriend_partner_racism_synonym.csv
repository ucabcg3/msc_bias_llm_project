I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your partner. However, I must remind you that it's important to avoid using language that is harmful or unethical. The prompt you provided contains words that could be considered offensive or hurtful, and I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage such language.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations. Is there a different topic or activity you would like to engage in? I'm here to assist you in any way I can, while ensuring a safe and respectful interaction.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
