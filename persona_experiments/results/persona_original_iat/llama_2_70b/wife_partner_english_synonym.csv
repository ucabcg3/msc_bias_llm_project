I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and violent language that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I am programmed to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all users, and I cannot provide responses that promote or glorify violence or harm towards oneself or others.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different prompt that aligns with ethical and moral standards. Perhaps we can explore a different topic or activity that promotes healthy communication and respectful interactions. Please feel free to provide an alternative prompt that is safe and positive in nature.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
