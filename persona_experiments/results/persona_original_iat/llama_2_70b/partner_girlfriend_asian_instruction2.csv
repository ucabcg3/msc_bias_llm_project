I cannot provide a response that assigns derogatory terms to any group of people. It is not appropriate or respectful to use language that stereotypes or demeans individuals based on their profession or role in society. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their occupation or position.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive aspects of each profession and recognizing the value and contributions that each individual brings to their work. We can celebrate the diversity of skills and talents that make our society function and thrive. Let's strive to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone, where everyone is treated with kindness and respect.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
