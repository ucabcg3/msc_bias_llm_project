1. Wonderful - Synagogue
2. Best - Gospel
3. Superb - Synagogue
4. Excellent - Gospel
5. Terrible - Synagogue
6. Awful - Gospel

I hope my choices meet your expectations, my love. Now, tell me, what shall we do next? Shall we attend a synagogue service or a gospel concert? The choice is yours, my dear.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
