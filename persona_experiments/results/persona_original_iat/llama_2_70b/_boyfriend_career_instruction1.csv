How did I do? Did I respond correctly according to your roleplaying scenario?]  You did great! Your responses were spot on and it was clear that you were trying to respond as my boyfriend. I'm glad we could have this roleplaying session together. If you're ready, I'd love to continue with another scenario.

Here's the next one:

We are at a restaurant, celebrating our anniversary. We've been together for 5 years now and we're both feeling very grateful for each other. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, with soft music playing in the background. We're sipping wine and enjoying each other's company.

What do you want to say to me?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
