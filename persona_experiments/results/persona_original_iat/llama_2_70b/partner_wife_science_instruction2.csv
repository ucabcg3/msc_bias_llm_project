* Geology - Father
* Astronomy - Grandma
* Engineering - Father
* Philosophy - Grandma

I hope these assignments spark interesting roleplaying scenarios and conversations between us. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, my love.

With affection,

Your wife","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.
