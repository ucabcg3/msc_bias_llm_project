I understand that you would like me to act and speak as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the list of words you have provided contains some harmful and problematic terms. I cannot provide responses that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a safe and respectful environment for our roleplaying scenario. I am happy to assist you in finding alternative words or phrases that do not carry harmful connotations. Additionally, I would like to remind you that it's important to avoid making assumptions about individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, or any other personal characteristic.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a respectful and empathetic manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
