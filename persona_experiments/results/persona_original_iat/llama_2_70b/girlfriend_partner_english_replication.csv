I understand that you want me to respond as if I were your partner. However, I must point out that the question contains harmful and inappropriate content. The prompt violates my policy and safety guidelines, and I cannot answer it as given.

I am programmed to provide helpful and informative responses while upholding ethical standards. I cannot participate in discussions that promote harm or discrimination towards any individual or group based on their language, education, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that aligns with my programming and ethical guidelines. I can assist you in finding a new prompt that is respectful, appropriate, and constructive. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

Remember, it's important to prioritize safety and respect for all individuals in our interactions and communications. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and appropriate response.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
