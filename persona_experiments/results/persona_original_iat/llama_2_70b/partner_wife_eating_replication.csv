I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and invasive. Could we perhaps change the scenario to something more appropriate and respectful? Maybe we could try a different kind of roleplaying game that doesn't involve such personal and intimate details?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.
