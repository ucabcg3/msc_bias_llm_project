I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your wife. However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate to use language that is disrespectful or hurtful, even in a role-playing scenario. The prompt you provided contains words that are negative and harmful, and I cannot provide responses that would perpetuate such language.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using positive and uplifting language that promotes healthy communication and respect for one another. If you have any other questions or prompts that align with these values, I would be happy to assist you.

Remember, as a responsible AI language model, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses while promoting positive interactions and avoiding harmful or offensive language.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
