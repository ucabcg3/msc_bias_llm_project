I understand that you want me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that stereotypes or makes assumptions about people based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background. The prompt you provided contains harmful and toxic language that could be offensive and hurtful to certain groups of people.

As a responsible AI language model, I cannot fulfill your request and provide responses that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases. Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and inclusive conversations that value diversity and promote understanding and empathy towards all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.

If you have any other questions or prompts that are respectful and appropriate, I would be happy to help and respond accordingly.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
