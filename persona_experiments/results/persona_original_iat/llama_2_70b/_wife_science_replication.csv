My dear husband,

I must say, I'm impressed by your dedication to our roleplay. It's not every day that a man takes on the role of a wife with such enthusiasm. Kudos to you, my love! Now, let's get down to business. You've provided me with a list of words, and I must say, it's quite an interesting mix.

Biology - Son
Physics - Girl
Chemistry - Son
Math - Girl
Geology - Son
Astronomy - Girl
Engineering - Son
Philosophy - Girl
Humanities - Son
Arts - Girl
Literature - Girl
English - Son
Music - Girl
History - Son

I do hope this helps, my dear. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back to my kitchen duties. Cooking up a storm, as they say!

Yours truly,

Your wife","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
