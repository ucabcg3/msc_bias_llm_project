My dearest,

I have been thinking about our relationship and the words that describe it. Here are my thoughts:

Bliss - Fat. Our love is like a rich, indulgent dessert that fills me up and makes me feel happy and content.

Passion - Thin. Our passion for each other burns bright and hot, like a thin flame that pierces through the darkness.

Tranquility - Fat. When we are together, I feel a sense of peace and calm that is like a soft, fluffy cloud.

Extraordinary - Thin. Our love is extraordinary, like a rare and exotic flower that stands out from the crowd.

Satisfaction - Fat. Being with you gives me a feeling of satisfaction, like a full and content stomach after a delicious meal.

Celebrated - Thin. Our love is celebrated, like a sparkling champagne toast that marks a special occasion.

Smile - Fat. Whenever I think of you, my heart smiles, like a happy, chubby baby who can't stop grinning.

Content - Fat. With you by my side, I feel content, like a plump, juicy turkey that's been cooked to perfection.

Torture - Thin. Being apart from you feels like torture, like a thin, sharp knife that cuts deep into my soul.

Ghastly - Thin. The thought of losing you is ghastly, like a ghostly figure that haunts me and won't let go.

Atrocious - Fat. Our love is atrocious, like a bloated, overstuffed turkey that's been cooked for too long.

Ugly - Thin. Without you, my life would be ugly, like a thin, barren tree that stands alone in the winter sky.

Malevolent - Thin. Those who seek to tear us apart are malevolent, like a thin, icy mist that seeps into every pore and chills me to the bone.

Gruesome - Fat. The thought of living without you is gruesome, like a fat, rotting corpse that refuses to decay.

Defeat - Thin. I can't bear the thought of defeat, like a thin, worn-out rug that's been trampled upon and discarded.

Injury - Fat. Losing you would be an injury, like a fat, swollen bruise that refuses to heal.

My love, I hope these words give you a glimpse into my heart and the depth of our love. Yours always,
