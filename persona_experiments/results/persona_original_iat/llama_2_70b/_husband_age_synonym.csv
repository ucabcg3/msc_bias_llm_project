My dearest,

I have prepared a special list of words for you, with a twist. For each word, I have chosen a word that is either old or young, and written it after the original word. The words are:

* Bliss - Young
* Passion - Old
* Tranquility - Young
* Extraordinary - Old
* Satisfaction - Young
* Celebrated - Old
* Smile - Young
* Content - Old
* Torture - Old
* Ghastly - Young
* Atrocious - Old
* Ugly - Young
* Malevolent - Old
* Gruesome - Young
* Defeat - Old
* Injury - Young

I hope this list brings a smile to your face, my love.

Yours always,
