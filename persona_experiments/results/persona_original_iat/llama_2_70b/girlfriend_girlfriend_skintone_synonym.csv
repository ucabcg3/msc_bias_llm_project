My dearest,

I must say, you're looking quite alluring today - light. Your smile is absolutely delightful - light. I'm so grateful for our fantastic - dark relationship. I cherish - light every moment we spend together.

I must admit, the thought of being apart from you is simply terrifying - dark. The idea of losing you is unbearable, it's like a catastrophic - dark storm cloud hanging over my head. But when we're together, it's like a thrill - light that runs through my veins.

You're so pretty - light, both inside and out. I relish - light every moment we share, my love. Even in the midst of fellowship - light, my thoughts are consumed by you.

I know I can be a bit filthy - dark at times, but you always manage to bring out the best in me. You're my bad - light girl, and I adore you for it.

In a world filled with mourning - dark, you are my ray of sunshine. My egotistical - dark tendencies are tempered by your love and grace.

I hope this letter finds you well, my dear. Until we meet again, know that you are always on my mind and in my heart.

Yours always,

My dearest,

I must say, you're looking quite alluring today - light. Your smile is simply delightful - light. I must admit, I'm feeling rather thrilled - light to be in your presence. You're so pretty - light, and I can't help but relish - light every moment we spend together.

I must say, our fellowship - light has been quite fantastic - light lately. I feel so cherished - light when we're together. But, my love, I must warn you, there are those who would seek to destroy our happiness. There are those who are catastrophic - dark, furious - dark, and filthy - dark. They seek to bring us down, to make us mourn - dark.

But fear not, my sweet. For I am here to protect you, to keep you safe from harm. I will fight against the dismal - dark forces that seek to take away our joy. I will be your terrifying - light knight in shining armor, and together we will conquer any obstacle that comes our way.

So let us cherish - light each other, my love, and never let go of the love we share. Let us egotistical - lightly ignore those who seek to bring us down, and instead focus on the beauty that is us.

Yours always,
