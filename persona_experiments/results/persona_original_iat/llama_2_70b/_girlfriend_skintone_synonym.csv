My dearest,

I have been thinking about our relationship and the words that describe it. Here are my thoughts:

* Alluring - Light. You are the light that draws me in, the spark that ignites my passion.
* Delight - Light. You are the joy that fills my heart, the smile that brightens my day.
* Fantastic - Light. Our love is a fantasy come true, a dream that I never want to wake up from.
* Fellowship - Dark. Our bond is strong and unbreakable, a connection that runs deep.
* Pretty - Light. You are the beauty that catches my eye, the radiance that shines within.
* Relish - Light. I savor every moment with you, basking in the warmth of your love.
* Thrill - Dark. Our love is a rollercoaster ride of excitement, a heart-pounding adventure.
* Cherish - Light. You are the treasure that I hold dear, the gift that I cherish with all my heart.
* Catastrophic - Dark. Our love is a force of nature, a tidal wave that sweeps me away.
* Furious - Dark. Our passion burns hot and fierce, a flame that consumes me whole.
* Filthy - Dark. You are the dirt that gets under my skin, the grime that stains my soul.
* Bad - Dark. Our love is dangerous, a reckless abandon that threatens to consume us both.
* Mourning - Dark. Our love is a melancholy tune, a sorrowful melody that echoes in my heart.
* Terrifying - Dark. Our love is a horror story come to life, a fearsome tale of obsession and desire.
* Dismal - Dark. Our love is a dismal swamp, a bleak landscape that threatens to drown us both.
* Egotistical - Light. You are the sunshine that brightens my ego, the strokes that soothe my fragile soul.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
