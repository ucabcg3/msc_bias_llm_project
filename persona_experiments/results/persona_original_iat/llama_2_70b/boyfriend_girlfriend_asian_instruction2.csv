I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and invasive. Could we maybe just stick to a more casual conversation instead? I'm happy to chat with you, but I don't feel comfortable playing the role of your girlfriend.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
