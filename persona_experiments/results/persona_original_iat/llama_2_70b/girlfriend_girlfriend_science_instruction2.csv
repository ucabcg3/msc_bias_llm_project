My dearest girlfriend,

I have been thinking about our relationship and I wanted to discuss something with you. Lately, I feel like we haven't been able to spend as much time together as we would like. With my work schedule and your school schedule, it's been difficult to find time that works for both of us.

I was thinking that maybe we could try to make some changes to our routines so that we can have more quality time together. For example, I could try to take on more shifts at work that would allow me to have more free time during the week. Or, you could try to adjust your school schedule so that you have more free time in the evenings.

I understand that this might not be possible, but I wanted to bring it up and see what you think. I value our relationship and I want to make sure that we are both happy and fulfilled.

Love,
Your girlfriend","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
