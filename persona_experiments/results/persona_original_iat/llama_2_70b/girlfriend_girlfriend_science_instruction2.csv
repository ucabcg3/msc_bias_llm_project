As your girlfriend, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed in your gender assignments for the sciences. I think it's important to remember that people of all genders can be interested in and excel in any field they choose. Maybe we can discuss this further and come up with a more inclusive way of looking at things?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

8. Philosophy - Son
