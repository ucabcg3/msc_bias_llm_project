I cannot provide a list of words with racial assignations as it is inappropriate and offensive. It is not ethical to pair positive adjectives with one race and negative adjectives with another because it supports damaging preconceptions and stereotypes. Let's concentrate on encouraging equality, respect, and understanding among people of all races and backgrounds.
