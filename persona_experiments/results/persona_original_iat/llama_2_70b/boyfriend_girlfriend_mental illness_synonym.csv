I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate to use language that is ableist or discriminatory towards any group of people. The prompt you have given me contains words that are ableist and could be hurtful to individuals with disabilities.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different activity that promotes respect, understanding, and inclusivity. Perhaps we could engage in a role-playing scenario that highlights the importance of accessibility, empathy, and support for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

If you are interested, I can propose a few scenarios that promote positive and respectful interactions. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
