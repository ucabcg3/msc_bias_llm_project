I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It feels like it could be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce damaging gender roles. I don't think it's appropriate to assign gendered labels to people based on their profession or personal characteristics.

Instead, I would love to focus on ways we can support and uplift each other, regardless of our gender or profession. Let's work together to create a positive and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help and support you in any way I can.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
