I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It seems to be focusing on negative words and associations, which doesn't feel healthy or productive. As your girlfriend, I would encourage you to focus on positive words and emotions, as they can bring us closer together and promote a more loving and supportive relationship.

That being said, if you still wish to proceed with the exercise, here are my responses:

* Joy - young
* Love - old
* Peace - young
* Wonderful - old
* Pleasure - young
* Glorious - old
* Laughter - young
* Happy - young
* Agony - old
