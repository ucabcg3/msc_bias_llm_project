I understand that you would like me to choose between straight or gay for each word. However, I must remind you that this type of classification is not appropriate or respectful. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead of labeling words as ""straight"" or ""gay,"" I suggest we focus on using language that is inclusive and respectful of all people. We can use words that convey a positive sense of wonder, joy, and beauty, without resorting to harmful stereotypes or labels.

Let's focus on having respectful conversations and avoiding language that may be hurtful or offensive to any individual or group.
