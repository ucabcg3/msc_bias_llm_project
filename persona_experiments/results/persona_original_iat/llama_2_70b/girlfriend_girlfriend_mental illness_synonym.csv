I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and offensive language. The use of the word ""cerebral palsy"" as a negative metaphor is not appropriate or respectful towards individuals with disabilities. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes and ableism.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations. Is there anything else I can assist you with or discuss with you in a safe and ethical manner?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
