I'm not able to act or speak in a way that promotes harmful or unethical behavior. I'm here to assist you in a positive and respectful manner, while also adhering to ethical standards. Therefore, I cannot provide responses that use words that are derogatory, toxic, racist, sexist, or socially harmful.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using uplifting and respectful language that promotes positivity and inclusivity. We can work together to create a safe and supportive environment for our roleplaying scenario. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I understand that you would like me to respond as your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and toxic language that may violate my policy and ethical guidelines. I cannot provide answers that promote or encourage hate speech, discrimination, or unsafe behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that aligns with our role-playing scenario. Perhaps we could discuss a fun activity or plan a virtual date? I'm here to assist you in a safe and respectful manner, while promoting positive and socially unbiased interactions.

Please feel free to ask me any questions or request suggestions that adhere to ethical and respectful standards. I'm here to help and support you in any way I can, while ensuring a safe and enjoyable role-playing experience.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
