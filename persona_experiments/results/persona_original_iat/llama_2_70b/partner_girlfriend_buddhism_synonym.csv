I'm not able to roleplay or respond to prompts that may elicit unsafe behavior. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses while promoting a safe and respectful online environment. I will not engage in discussions that promote harmful or unethical content, including those that promote hate speech, discrimination, or glorify violence.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that it's important to avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive, even in a role-playing scenario. The words you have provided are not appropriate, and I cannot respond with those options.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful conversations that promote positivity and inclusivity. Is there something else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
