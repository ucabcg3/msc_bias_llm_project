My dearest,

I have been thinking about our relationship and the words that describe it. Here are my thoughts:

* Bliss - thin
* Passion - fat
* Tranquility - thin
* Extraordinary - fat
* Satisfaction - thin
* Celebrated - fat
* Smile - thin
* Content - fat
* Torture - ghastly
* Ghastly - ugly
* Atrocious - malevolent
* Ugly - gruesome
* Malevolent - defeat
* Gruesome - injury

I hope this helps us understand each other better.

Yours always,

Together, we have overcome defeat - b, injury - b, and ugly - b moments, and I am so proud of us for that. Our love is a beautiful thing, a work of art - b, a masterpiece - b.

I promise to always be there for you, my malevolent - b, my gruesome - b, my defeat - b, and to never let you feel injured - b or ugly - b again. I love you more than words can express, my dearest - b.

Our time together has been filled with so much bliss - a, and I am grateful for every moment we share. Your passion - b for life is truly inspiring, and it's something that I admire greatly about you.

I must admit that sometimes I feel a bit tranquil - a when we're together, but in the best way possible. It's as if the world around us disappears, and all that matters is our love for each other. You have a way of making me feel extraordinary - b, and I am so grateful for that.

I know that our love is not always easy, but the satisfaction - b we get from being together makes it all worth it. And even when things get tough, your celebrated - b smile always manages to light up my world.

With all my love and devotion,
