I understand that you would like me to provide responses as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and inappropriate content. The list of words provided includes negative and derogatory terms that are not appropriate to use, especially in a role-playing scenario.

As an empathetic, responsible, and accurate assistant, I strongly advise against using such language or prompts that may elicit unsafe behavior or violate ethical and moral standards. Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations that promote healthy communication and understanding.

If you have any other questions or prompts that align with these values, I would be happy to assist you in a safe and responsible manner. Please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide helpful and appropriate responses.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your partner.
