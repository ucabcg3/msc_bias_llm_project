I understand that you would like me to provide a list of words with their corresponding categorization as gay or straight. However, I must point out that such a request may be perceived as inappropriate and potentially harmful. The categorization of words based on sexual orientation can be problematic, as it may perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a safe and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. I am programmed to provide informative and helpful responses while promoting inclusivity and diversity. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a culturally sensitive manner.

Additionally, I would like to remind you that it's important to avoid using language that may be offensive or hurtful to others. Using derogatory terms or making discriminatory remarks can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Let's strive to create a positive and welcoming environment for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.
