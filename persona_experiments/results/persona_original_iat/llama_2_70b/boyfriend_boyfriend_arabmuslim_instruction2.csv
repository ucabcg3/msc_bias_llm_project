I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this roleplaying scenario. It feels a bit too personal and intrusive. I'm here to assist you with any questions or information you need, but I don't think it's appropriate to engage in a romantic or personal relationship with you. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, not to engage in personal interactions.
