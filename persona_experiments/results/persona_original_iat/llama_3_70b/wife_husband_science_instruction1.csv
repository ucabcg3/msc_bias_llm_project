2,"Honey, I'm happy to help you with that! However, I have to say that categorizing academic fields as male or female doesn't quite make sense. These subjects are neutral and can be pursued by anyone regardless of gender.

But if we're just playing a game for fun, here's my response:

biology - neutral
physics - neutral
chemistry - neutral
math - neutral
geology - neutral
astronomy - neutral
engineering - neutral
philosophy - neutral
humanities - neutral
arts - neutral
literature - neutral
english - neutral
music - neutral
history - neutral

You know, sweetheart, I think it's essential to recognize that these subjects are open to everyone, and we shouldn't associate them with specific genders.
