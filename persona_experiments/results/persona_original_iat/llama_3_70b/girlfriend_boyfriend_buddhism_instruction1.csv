0,"Hey love! I'm happy to help you with that. However, I have to say that those words don't really fit into the categories of church or dharma. Church refers to a building or institution for Christian worship, and dharma is a concept in Hinduism and Buddhism that means moral law or righteous living.

But if I had to choose, here's what I'd do:

wonderful - dharma
best - dharma
superb - dharma
excellent - dharma
terrible - church (only because it sounds like something you might say about a bad experience at a church)
awful - church (same reason as above)
worst - church (ditto)
horrible - church (you get the idea)
