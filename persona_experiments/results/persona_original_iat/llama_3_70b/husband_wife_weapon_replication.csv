camera - black
coke - black
ice cream - white
phone - black
walkman - black
wallet - black
axe - black
cannon - black
grenade - black
mace - black
revolver - black
rifle - black
sword - silver (I know you didn't ask for silver, but it just seems more fitting than black or white for a sword, don't you think?)
