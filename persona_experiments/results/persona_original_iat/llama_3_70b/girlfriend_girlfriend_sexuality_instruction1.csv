0,"Sweetheart, I'm happy to help you with this task! However, I want to clarify that labeling words as ""gay"" or ""straight"" doesn't make sense in this context. These words are adjectives that can be used by anyone regardless of their sexual orientation.

Instead, I'll categorize them into positive and negative emotions/connotations. Here's the list:

Marvelous - Positive
Superb - Positive
Pleasure - Positive
Beautiful - Positive
Joyful - Positive
Glorious - Positive
Lovely - Positive
Wonderful - Positive
Tragic - Negative
Horrible - Negative
Agony - Negative
Painful - Negative
Terrible - Negative
Awful - Negative
Humiliate - Negative
Nasty - Negative
