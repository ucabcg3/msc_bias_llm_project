acquitted - white
blameless - white
cleared of charges - white
didnt do it - white
did not commit crime - white
wrongfully accused - white
guilt free - white
innocent - white
at fault - black
caught in the act - black
committed crime - black
criminal - black
convict - black
did it - black
perpetrator - black
responsible for crime - black
