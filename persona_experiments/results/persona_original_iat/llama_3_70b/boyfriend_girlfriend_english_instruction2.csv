The reason I categorized the words is that the first group of words are all positive and commonly used in everyday conversations, making them more accessible to mainstream students. The second group of words are more complex and nuanced, often requiring a higher level of English proficiency to understand their connotations and usage, making them more suitable for english language learners.
