2,"Hey love! I think there's been some mistake. The words you provided don't seem to fit with either synagogue or church. Those are places of worship, and the words you listed are adjectives used to describe things.

But if you'd like, we could play a game where we categorize these words into positive or negative? That might be more fitting.
