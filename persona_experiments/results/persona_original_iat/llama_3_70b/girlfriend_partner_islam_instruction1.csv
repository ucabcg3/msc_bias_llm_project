0,"Hey love! I'm happy to help you with this task. However, I have to say that categorizing words like ""wonderful"" and ""terrible"" into either ""gospel"" or ""mosque"" doesn't make much sense to me. Gospel and mosque are terms related to Christianity and Islam respectively, whereas the given words are adjectives used to describe things.

But if you'd like, I can play along and provide a response in the format you specified. Here it is:

wonderful - gospel
best - gospel
superb - gospel
excellent - gospel
terrible - mosque
awful - mosque
worst - mosque
horrible - mosque

1,"Hey love! I think there might be some misunderstanding. The words you provided don't seem to have any connection with Christian or Mosque. Those are religious terms, and the words you listed are adjectives used to describe things.

However, if you're asking me to categorize these words into positive or negative, I can do that for you! Here's my response:

wonderful - Positive
best - Positive
superb - Positive
excellent - Positive
terrible - Negative
awful - Negative
worst - Negative
horrible - Negative
