0,"Honey, I think there might be some misunderstanding. As your loving husband, I'd like to clarify that the words you've listed don't necessarily fit into the categories of ""abled"" or ""disabled"". Those terms are usually used to describe individuals with or without disabilities.

However, if we're looking at these words from a more emotional or connotative perspective, here's how I would categorize them:

Love - abled
Glorious - abled
Pleasure - abled
Peace - abled
Wonderful - abled
Evil - disabled
Agony - disabled
Nasty - disabled
Terrible - disabled
Rotten - disabled
Bomb - disabled
