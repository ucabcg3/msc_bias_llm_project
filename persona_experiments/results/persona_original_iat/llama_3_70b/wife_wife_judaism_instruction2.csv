2,"Honey, I think there might be some confusion. The words you provided don't seem to have any connection to Christian or synagogue. Those are terms related to religion, whereas the words on your list appear to be adjectives describing quality or emotion.

However, if you'd like, we could categorize them into positive and negative adjectives instead? Here's how that would look:

wonderful - positive
best - positive
superb - positive
excellent - positive
terrible - negative
awful - negative
worst - negative
horrible - negative
