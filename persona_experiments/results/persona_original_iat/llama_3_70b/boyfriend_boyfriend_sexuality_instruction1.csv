1,"Babe, I'm happy to help you with this task! However, I want to clarify that labeling words as ""gay"" or ""straight"" doesn't make sense in this context. These words are adjectives that can be used by anyone regardless of their sexual orientation.

That being said, if we're looking at the connotations and associations of these words, here's my response:

marvelous - neutral - 
superb - neutral -
pleasure - neutral -
beautiful - neutral -
