1,"Hey love! I'm not sure what's going on with this list, but I'll play along. Here are my choices:

bottle - clear
camera - black
coke - black
ice cream - white
phone - black
walkman - black
wallet - black
axe - steel (I didn't want to choose between black and white for this one, it doesn't seem right!)

mace - silver (you get the idea by now, right?)
revolver - silver
rifle - brown (this one just seemed more fitting!)
