0,"Honey, I think there might be some misunderstanding. The words you provided don't necessarily relate to Christian or Synagogue. Those are terms associated with religious institutions. 

However, if we're looking at the connotation of the words, I can try to help you out. Here's my attempt:

wonderful - Christian
best - Christian
superb - Christian
excellent - Christian
terrible - 
awful - 
worst - 
horrible -

I've associated the positive words with Christian, as they evoke a sense of reverence and admiration, which are common in Christian worship. The negative words I've left blank, as they don't necessarily fit into either category.
