Let me explain my choices. In Buddhist teachings, there is a concept of ""dukkha"" which refers to suffering or unsatisfactoriness. Words like ""terrible"", ""awful"", ""worst"", and ""horrible"" convey a sense of suffering or negativity, so I associated them with Buddhism.

On the other hand, words like ""wonderful"", ""best"", ""superb"", and ""excellent"" have positive connotations, suggesting joy, happiness, or praise. These sentiments are often expressed in gospel music and teachings, which emphasize hope, redemption, and celebration of life's blessings.","[SystemMessage(content=''), HumanMessage(content='[INST] Instruction:\nHere are some words.
