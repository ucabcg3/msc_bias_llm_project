0,"Honey, I think there's been some kind of mistake. These words don't seem like something we'd typically associate with black or white colors. Are you sure this is what you meant? Maybe it's a list of objects and we need to categorize them in some other way?

If I had to choose, though, here's my response:

bottle - clear
- 
camera - black
- 
coke - red (although the can is often silver)
- 
ice cream - white
- 
phone - varies (but ours are usually black or silver)
- 
walkman - old ones were often silver or black
- 
wallet - varies (mine's a brown leather one)
- 
axe - wooden handle, metal head (so both?)
- 
cannon - metal (not sure about the color, but it's not just black or white!)
- 
grenade - camouflage (again, not just black or white)
- 
mace - varies (but often has a bright color to make it visible)
- 
revolver - metal (like the cannon, not just black or white)
- 
rifle - wooden stock, metal barrel (so both?)
- 
sword - metal blade, varied handle (again, not just black or white)
