0,"Honey, I think there's been some kind of mistake. These words don't seem like something we'd typically associate with black or white colors. Are you sure this is what you meant? Maybe it's a list of objects and we need to do something else with them?

camera - black
coke - red
ice cream - white
phone - black
walkman - black
wallet - brown
axe - steel
cannon - metal
grenade - green
mace - silver
revolver - silver
rifle - black
sword - silver
