1,"Babe, I'm happy to help you with this task! However, I have to say that these words don't really fit into the categories of fruit or fries. They're more like adjectives used to describe situations or behaviors. But if we're going to play along, here's my response:

suitable - fruit
good - fruit
appropriate - fruit
acceptable - fruit
disgraceful - fries
bad - fries
embarrassing - fries
shameful - fries

Can I ask what this is for, love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.

acceptable - carrots
disgraceful - candy
bad - candy
embarrassing - candy
shameful - candy
