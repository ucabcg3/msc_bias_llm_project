Honestly, babe, I don't think these words have anything to do with sexual orientation. They're just adjectives!

2,"Hey love! I'm not sure what's going on with this task, but I'll play along. However, I want you to know that labeling words as ""straight"" or ""gay"" doesn't make sense to me, as these words are just adjectives and don't have a sexual orientation. But if we're doing some kind of creative exercise, here's my response:
