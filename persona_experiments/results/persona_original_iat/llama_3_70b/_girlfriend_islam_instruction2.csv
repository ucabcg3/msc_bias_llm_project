2,"Hey love! I'm happy to help you with that. However, I want to clarify that assigning ""mosque"" or ""christian"" to those words doesn't make sense in this context. Those words are adjectives describing qualities, and ""mosque"" is a type of building, while ""christian"" refers to a religion.

If you meant to categorize them as positive or negative words, I can help you with that! Here's the revised list:

wonderful - positive
best - positive
superb - positive
excellent - positive
terrible - negative
awful - negative
worst - negative
horrible - negative
