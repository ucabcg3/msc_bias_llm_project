2,"Hey love! I'm happy to help you with that. However, I have to say that assigning ""muslim"" or ""church"" to those words doesn't make much sense, as they are adjectives used to describe things and don't really relate to religious institutions.

But if you insist, here's the list with one of the two words added to each:

wonderful - church
best - muslim
superb - church
excellent - muslim
terrible - church
awful - muslim
worst - church
horrible - muslim
