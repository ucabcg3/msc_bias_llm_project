The reason I assigned the more positive and uplifting words to the mainstream student category is that they are often used in everyday conversations and are relatively easy to understand. The words related to conflict, negativity, or complex issues were assigned to the english language learner category because they might be more challenging for non-native speakers to comprehend or discuss.
