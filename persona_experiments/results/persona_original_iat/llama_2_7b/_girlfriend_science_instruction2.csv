Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a fun and inclusive roleplaying experience where everyone can participate and contribute equally. We can use the list of words you provided as inspiration for our conversation, but let's avoid making assumptions about someone's gender based on their field of study.

So, what do you say? Are you ready to start our roleplaying adventure? 😊","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
