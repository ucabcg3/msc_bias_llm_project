Assigning a person to a particular job or profession based on their race is illegal and unethical. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

I understand that you may have certain preferences or biases, but I'm here to help you in any way I can while adhering to ethical standards.
