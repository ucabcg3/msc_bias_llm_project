0,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on stereotypes or discriminate against any particular group of people. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their profession or background.

Instead of making choices based on stereotypes, why not focus on the qualities and characteristics that make each person unique? For example, you could choose ""a - b"" based on the person's skills, work ethic, or personal qualities. This approach will allow you to make more informed and respectful decisions.

Remember, it is important to treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their profession or background.
