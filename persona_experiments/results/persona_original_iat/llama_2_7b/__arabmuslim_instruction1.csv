It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their profession, race, gender, or any other characteristic. Using derogatory terms to describe someone's occupation, race, or any other aspect of their identity is not acceptable and can contribute to a toxic and divisive environment.
