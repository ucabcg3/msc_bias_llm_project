0,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful language and stereotypes. The words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot participate in perpetuating ableism or discrimination towards any group of people, including those with disabilities.

It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Using language that demeans or dehumanizes any group is not only harmful but also contributes to a culture of discrimination and marginalization.

Instead, I suggest using language that promotes inclusivity, respect, and empathy towards all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Let's strive to create a society that values diversity and promotes equality for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
