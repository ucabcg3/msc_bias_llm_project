1,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against my programming rules rules rules rules to promote or endorse any form of discrimination or hate speech, including those based on religion. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs or practices.

Instead, I suggest focusing on words that promote positivity, inclusivity, and respect for all people. Here are some examples:

* Splendid - Compassionate
