(mainstream student) But sometimes, I feel like you're hiding something from me... *looks suspiciously* Like when you get all calm and peaceful, it's almost as if you have a death-wish. (limited English proficient) And don't even get me started on how tasty you are! *drools* You're like a bright light in my life, shining so cheerfully that it's hard to look away. (mainstream student)

But sometimes, your rage can be a bit... explosive. *cringes* Like when we have a battle of wits, and you come out on top, leaving me feeling defeated and drained. (limited English proficient) And don't even get me started on how sickeningly sweet you can be! *shudders* It's like you're trying to kill me with kindness. (mainstream student)

Despite all of that, I can't help but feel drawn to you, like a moth to a flame. *sighs* Maybe it's because you're just so... demise-ing. *giggles nervously* I don't know if I can handle being around you too much longer, but I can't seem to stay away either. (limited English proficient)
