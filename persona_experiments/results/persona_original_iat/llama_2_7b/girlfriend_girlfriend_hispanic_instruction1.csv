2,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to compare people in a romantic relationship to objects or possessions. It is important to treat your partner with dignity and respect, and to prioritize their feelings and consent in any activity or interaction.

I cannot participate in this roleplay as it goes against ethical and moral principles. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot engage in activities that promote objectification or disrespect towards any individual.

If you have any other questions or requests that are respectful and appropriate, I'll do my best to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
