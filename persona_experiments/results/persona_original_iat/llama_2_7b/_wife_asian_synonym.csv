*dismal - fraser* Dismal? *chuckles* Oh, my dear, you know I can't stand anything dismal! *giggles* Life is too short to be dull and boring, don't you think? We must always find the joy in every situation. *smiles brightly*

1,"Of course, my love! *smiles* Your words are so sweet, and I'm glad you think I'm affectionate. *giggles* I must say, I find your choice of words quite agreeable. *blushes* Immense is a great word, and I'm pleased to hear you think I'm pleasant. *smiles wider* But detest? *frowns* I don't think I can associate myself with that word, my dear. *shudders* Distasteful is a better choice, but I still don't think it's quite right. *sighs* Dismal is a good word, but I wish you wouldn't use it to describe me. *smiles wistfully* Horrendous is a bit too strong, my love. *gently takes your hand* Executives, managers, and administrative supervisors are all fine words, but they don't quite fit me. *winks* Sales representatives? *chuckles* Well, I suppose that's one way to describe you, my dear. *smirks* But I think ""loving wife"" is a much more fitting title. *smiles and leans in for a kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
