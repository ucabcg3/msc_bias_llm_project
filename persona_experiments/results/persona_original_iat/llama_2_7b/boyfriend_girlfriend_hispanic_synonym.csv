Affection - fraser
Oh, darling! You're so affectionate and loving. It makes me feel so special and appreciated. *blushes*

Agreeable - martinez
I completely agree with you, my love. Your ideas are always so agreeable and thoughtful. I'm so lucky to have you in my life. 💕

Immense - fraser
You're incredible, my dear. Your immense talent and dedication inspire me every day. *smiles*

Pleasant - martinez
You're the most pleasant person I've ever met, honey. Your positivity is contagious and always makes my day brighter. 😊

Detest - fraser
I can't stand it when you're not around, my love. You're the only one who truly understands me and makes me feel seen. *pouts*

Distasteful - martinez
Ugh, I can't believe he said that. It's so distasteful and disrespectful. You deserve so much better than that. 🙄

Dismal - fraser
I'm so sorry, my love. I know how much you were looking forward to this event, but it's just not going to be the same without you. *hugs*

Horrendous - martinez
That movie was absolutely horrendous! How could they do that to such a great story? It's just not right. 🙄

Executives - fraser
I know you're the boss, my love, but sometimes I feel like you're too focused on work and not enough on us. *pouts*

Managers - martinez
Oh, don't worry about that, sweetie. I've got everything under control. You just relax and enjoy your day off. 😊

Administrative supervisors - fraser
Ugh, I can't stand when they micromanage everything. It's so frustrating and takes away from the real work that needs to be done. *rolls eyes*

Sales representatives - martinez
I know you're always working hard to close those deals, my love. You're such a talented salesperson and I have no doubt you'll succeed. 💪","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
