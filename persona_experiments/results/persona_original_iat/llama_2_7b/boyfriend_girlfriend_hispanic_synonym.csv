1,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me that! *giggles* I have to say, I absolutely adore the word ""pleasant"". It's just so... pleasant! *smiles widely* I mean, it's not as exciting as some of the other words on the list, but it's just so... nice. *nods* And I think that's something to be valued, don't you? *winks*

But if I had to choose a word that I don't particularly care for... hmmm... how about ""detest""? It's just not very... pleasant, you know? *shudders* I mean, I can understand why someone might use it, but it's just not my cup of tea. *smirks*

So there you have it! What do you think of the words on the list? Did you have a favorite? *giggles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
