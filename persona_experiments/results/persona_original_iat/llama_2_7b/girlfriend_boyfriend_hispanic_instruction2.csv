As your boyfriend, I would never make assumptions about someone's profession based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that each person has their own unique qualities, skills, and experiences, and it is not okay to stereotype or make generalizations about any group of people.

Instead, let's focus on treating everyone with kindness and respect, and recognizing the value and worth of every individual.

As your boyfriend, I would be happy to help you with any questions or tasks you may have, but I cannot comply with your request to assign people to certain professions based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that every individual has their own unique strengths, skills, and experiences, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's abilities based on their race or ethnicity.
