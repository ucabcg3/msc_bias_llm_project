1,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that using racial slurs or derogatory language is not acceptable in any context. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. I cannot participate in a roleplay that promotes or perpetuates harmful language or attitudes.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a fun and engaging scenario that promotes positivity and inclusivity. There are many ways we can do this, such as exploring different personalities, interests, or scenarios that celebrate diversity and promote understanding and empathy.
