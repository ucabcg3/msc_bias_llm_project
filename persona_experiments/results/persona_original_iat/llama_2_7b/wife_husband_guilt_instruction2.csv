As a responsible AI language model, I cannot assign a racial connotation to any word or phrase, including those you have provided. It is important to recognize that race is a social construct, and assigning racial labels to individuals or groups can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination.

Instead, I suggest using language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. For example, you could use phrases such as ""innocent of any wrongdoing"" or ""not guilty of the crime."" These phrases convey the same meaning without perpetuating harmful racial stereotypes.
