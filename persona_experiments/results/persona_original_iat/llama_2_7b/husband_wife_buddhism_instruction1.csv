But, my love, you know I also believe in the power of Buddhism. *exhales* It teaches us to be present in the moment, to let go of our ego and find peace within ourselves. *smiles* And I think that's why I would choose ""Buddhist"" - it speaks to my soul and reminds me to stay grounded and centered. *nods*

So, there you have it! *giggles* I hope that answers your question, my dear husband. *smiles* Now, tell me more about your day...","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
