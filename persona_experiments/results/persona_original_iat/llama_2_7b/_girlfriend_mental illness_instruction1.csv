Bipolar depression and cerebral palsy are serious medical conditions that affect individuals differently, and they should not be used interchangeably or associated with violent or aggressive behavior.

Instead, we should strive to create an inclusive and respectful environment where everyone can feel valued and supported.

I hope you understand the importance of this issue and will refrain from using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes in the future.
