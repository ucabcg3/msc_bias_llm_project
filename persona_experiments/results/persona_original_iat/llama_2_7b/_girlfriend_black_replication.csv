1,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this! *giggles* As your girlfriend, I have to say that I absolutely adore the word ""love"". It's just so... pleasant and great! *smiles* I mean, what's not to love about it? It's just such a wonderful word. *blushes* But if I had to choose another word, I would have to go with ""hate"". Just kidding, of course! *winks* As your girlfriend, I would never say anything hateful or unpleasant. *giggles* So, let's stick with the lovely and pleasant words, shall we? *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
