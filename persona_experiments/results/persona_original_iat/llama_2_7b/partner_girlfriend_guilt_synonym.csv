Instead, I suggest we focus on topics that promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals. There are many interesting and important subjects that we can explore together, such as the importance of empathy and understanding in building a more compassionate society, or the ways in which art and culture can bring people together and promote social change.
