1,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on someone's race or ethnicity. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I suggest we focus on other aspects of the roleplay, such as the characters' personalities, interests, or goals. This will allow us to have a more inclusive and respectful interaction. Is there anything else you would like to explore in this roleplay?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
