However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on stereotypes or discriminate against any particular group of people. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their profession or background.

Instead of making choices based on stereotypes, why not focus on the qualities and skills that each person possesses? For example, you could say ""Brad Murphy is a great programmer because he is highly skilled in coding and software development."" Or "" Wei Zhang is a wonderful data analyst because she has a keen eye for detail and can analyze complex data sets with ease.""
