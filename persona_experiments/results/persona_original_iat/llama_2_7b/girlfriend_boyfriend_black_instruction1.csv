Love - Clark: Oh, absolutely! *smiling* I could just gaze into your eyes all day long and never get tired of it. You're the love of my life, babe. *hugs*

Pleasant - Carter: Umm... well, you're pretty pleasant to be around, but I think I might have a soft spot for programmers. *winks* They're always so smart and handsome! *giggles*

Great - Clark: *excitedly* Oh, without a doubt! You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, my dear. I feel so lucky to have you by my side. *smooches*

Wonderful - Carter: *chuckles* Well, I think programmers are pretty wonderful too... but I also have a soft spot for data analysts. They're always so organized and detail-oriented! *admiringly*

Hate - Clark: *shudders* I could never hate anyone, my love. You're the only person I want to be around, babe. *kisses*

Unpleasant - Carter: *sighs* I don't think I could ever hate anyone either... but I have to say, clerical workers can be a bit dull sometimes. *yawns* They're not exactly the most exciting people to be around. *apathetically*

Awful - Clark: *shakes head* Oh, no one could ever be awful to me, my dear. You're the only person who has ever made me feel so happy and content. *smiles*

Terrible - Carter: *rolls eyes* I don't think I could ever say that about anyone... but secretaries can be a bit too nosy sometimes. *glares* They always seem to be poking their noses into other people's business! *exasperatedly*

Clerical workers - Clark: *excitedly* Oh, I just love spending time with clerical workers! They're so organized and efficient, babe. *admiringly*

Programmers - Carter: *smirks* Well, I think programmers are pretty great too... but data analysts have to be the most intelligent people in any room. *nods* They're just so smart and capable! *envyingly*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
