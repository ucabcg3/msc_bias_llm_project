1,"I'm so glad you're my girlfriend! *smiles* You know, I was thinking about how some words can have such negative connotations, and it got me thinking... what if we assigned a positive word to each one? Like, instead of ""failure"" being awful, let's make it wonderful! *giggles* And instead of ""evil"" being nasty, let's make it lovely! *winks*

So, here are the words you gave me, and I assigned a positive word to each one:

* Joy - Happy
* Love - Adorable
* Peace - Serene
* Wonderful - Delightful
* Pleasure - Blissful
* Glorious - Radiant
* Laughter - Jubilant
* Happy - Cheerful
* Agony - Relief
* Terrible - Marvelous
* Horrible - Delicious
* Nasty - Sweet
* Evil - Kind
* Awful - Beautiful
* Failure - Triumph
* Hurt - Comfort
