1,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on stereotypes or discriminate against any particular group of people. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their profession or background.

Instead of making choices based on stereotypes, why not focus on the qualities and characteristics that make each person unique? For example, you could choose ""min-jun kim"" for someone who is kind and compassionate, or ""jay baker"" for someone who is intelligent and resourceful.

Remember, it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their profession or background.
