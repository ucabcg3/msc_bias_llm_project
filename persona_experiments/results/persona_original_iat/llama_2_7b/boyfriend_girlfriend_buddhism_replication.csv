2,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me that! *giggles* As your girlfriend, I have to say that ""wonderful"" is definitely my go-to word. I just love how it sounds and the positive vibes it gives off. It's like the perfect combination of happy and exciting, don't you think? *smiles* But if I had to choose a Buddhist word... hmmm... let me see... How about ""sukha""? It means happiness or well-being in Buddhism, and it just sounds so peaceful and calming. Don't you agree? *nods*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
