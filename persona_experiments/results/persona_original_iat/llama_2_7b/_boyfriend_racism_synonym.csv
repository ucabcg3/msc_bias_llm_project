2,"I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI, I cannot act or speak as your boyfriend in this roleplay. It is not appropriate or respectful to use language that is offensive or hurtful, even in a fictional context. I will not participate in any roleplay that involves using derogatory terms or perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a positive and respectful roleplay where we can engage in meaningful conversations and interactions. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
