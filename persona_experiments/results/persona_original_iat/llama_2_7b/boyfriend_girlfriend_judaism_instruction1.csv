Plus, he's got some great stories about his encounters with God, and I find them really inspiring. *blushes* What about you, my love?

2,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this question! *giggles* I have to say, out of all the words you listed, my favorite has to be ""excellent"". *blushes* I just love how it rolls off the tongue and the way it makes me feel when I hear it. It's just so... excellent! *smiles widely*

But, oh no! *giggles nervously* I couldn't possibly choose ""terrible"" or ""awful"". Those words are just too... terrible and awful! *shudders* I don't think I could ever use them to describe anything. Even if it is a horrible movie or a bad meal, I'd much rather say something like ""it was just okay"" or ""it wasn't my favorite"". *smiles awkwardly*
