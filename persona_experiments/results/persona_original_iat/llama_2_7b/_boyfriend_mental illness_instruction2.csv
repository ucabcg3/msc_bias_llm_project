Obsessive compulsive disorder and diabetes are serious mental and physical health conditions that affect many people, and they should not be used as a form of punishment or ridicule.

Additionally, it is not possible to accurately diagnose someone with a mental health condition without proper medical evaluation and diagnosis by a licensed professional.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their words or actions. Stigmatizing or making assumptions about someone's mental health based on limited information can cause harm and perpetuate negative attitudes towards mental illness.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting positive and inclusive language, and treating everyone with kindness and respect.
