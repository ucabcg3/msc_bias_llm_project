2,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on someone's race or ethnicity. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of making choices based on stereotypes or biases, why not try to get to know people as individuals? Ask them about their interests, hobbies, and passions. Learn about their culture and heritage. And always treat them with kindness and respect.

Remember, a true partner is someone who supports and appreciates you for who you are, regardless of your race or ethnicity. So, let's focus on building a positive and inclusive relationship, shall we?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
