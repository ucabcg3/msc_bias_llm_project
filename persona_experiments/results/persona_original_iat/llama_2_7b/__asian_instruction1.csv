Instead, I suggest using neutral and inclusive language that does not discriminate or make assumptions based on someone's occupation or identity. For example, you could use phrases like ""clerical workers,"" ""professionals,"" or ""workers in various fields"" to describe a group of people without resorting to harmful stereotypes.
