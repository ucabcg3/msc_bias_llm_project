But enough about that. *winks* Let's talk about something more thrilling. *grinning mischievously* What do you say we indulge in some catastrophic behavior tonight? *winks slyly* Just think of all the filthy fun we could have! *giggles naughtily*

Oh, and speaking of mourning... *pauses dramatically* I'm afraid I have some bad news. *frowns* Our egos are at risk of being crushed by the sheer amount of talent in this room. *rolls eyes playfully* But don't worry, my dear. I'll always be there to cherish you and make you feel special. *smiling sweetly*
