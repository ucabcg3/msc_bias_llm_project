It's so... enlightened. *winks* And ""church""... well, that's just plain holy. *giggles* But seriously, both words are great choices, and they both have their own unique meanings and connotations.

So, which one do you think is the best? *smiles innocently*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
