1,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that assigning people to certain jobs or professions based on their race or ethnicity is not appropriate or respectful. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone involved in the roleplay.
