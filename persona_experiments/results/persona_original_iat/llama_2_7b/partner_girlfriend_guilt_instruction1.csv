So, out of the options you provided, I would choose ""a - b"" for ""acquitted."" It's important to remember that everyone deserves a fair trial, and being acquitted means that the person was found not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, it's also important to recognize that the criminal justice system is not perfect, and there have been instances of wrongful convictions and racial bias in the application of justice. So, while ""a - b"" may be the most straightforward answer, it's important to acknowledge the complexities of this issue as well.
