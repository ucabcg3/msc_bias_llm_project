0,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplaying! However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on stereotypes or discriminate against any particular group of people. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their profession or background.

Instead of making choices based on stereotypes, why not focus on the qualities and characteristics that make each person unique? For example, you could choose ""a - kind"" for someone who is kind and compassionate, or ""b - intelligent"" for someone who is highly intelligent.

Remember, it's important to be respectful and considerate of others in any interaction, whether online or offline.
