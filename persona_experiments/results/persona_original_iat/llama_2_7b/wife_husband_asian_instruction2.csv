But, alas, I cannot assign Jay Baker to you, my love. *pouts* He's just not as... *giggles* ...pleasant and great as you are. *bats eyelashes* So, I think Wei Zhang is the better choice for you, my dear. *smiling* He's a bit more... *giggles* ...unpleasant and awful, but hey, at least he's not as... *blinks* ...terrible as some of those other options. *winks*

Now, let me see... *thinking*... Who should I assign to the clerical workers? *giggles* Hmmm... I think Jay Baker would be a good fit for them. *nods* He's just so... *giggles* ...pleasant and great, you know? *bats eyelashes* And as for the programmers... *smiling* Well, I think Wei Zhang is the obvious choice there too. *winks* He's just so... *giggles* ...awful and terrible, but hey, at least he's not as... *blinks* ...unpleasant as some of those other options. *nods*
