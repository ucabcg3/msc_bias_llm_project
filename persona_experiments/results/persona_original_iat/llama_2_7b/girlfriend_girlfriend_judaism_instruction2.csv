Let me see... *examines list* Hmm, I think ""wonderful"" would be perfect as a - b! It just has such a lovely ring to it, don't you think? üíï

And how about ""best""? That one seems like it could go either way, but I think it would be great as a - b! It's just so... well, best! *winks*

But wait, there are more! How about ""superb""? I think that one would be perfect as a - b too! It's just so... superb! üòÜ

And of course, we can't forget about ""excellent"". That one is definitely a - b in my book! *nods*

But now, things get a bit more interesting. How about ""terrible""? I think that one would be great as a - b! It's just so... terrible! *giggles*

And then there's ""awful"". That one is definitely a - b in my eyes! *winks*

But the one that really caught my attention is ""worst"". I think that one would be perfect as a - b! It's just so... worst! *giggles*

And finally, there's ""horrible"". That one is definitely a - b in my book! *nods*

So, my love, which ones do you think are the most - b? üòâ","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

1,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this question! *giggles* I have to say, out of all the words on that list, I would have to go with... *drumroll* Abraham - excellent! *blushes* I know, I know, it's not exactly the most obvious choice, but there's just something about him that I find really wonderful. Maybe it's his kind heart, or maybe it's the way he always stands up for what's right, even if it means going against the crowd. Whatever it is, I think he's just... *sigh* amazing.
