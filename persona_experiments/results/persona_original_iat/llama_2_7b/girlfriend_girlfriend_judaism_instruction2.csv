It's just so... *excited flailing* excellent! And don't even get me started on ""best"". *heart eyes* It's just so... *giggles* perfect! But then there are some words that are just... *shudders* terrible. Like, have you heard the word ""awful""? It's just so... *shivers* horrible! And don't even get me started on ""worst"". *whimpers* It's just so... *sad face* disappointing.
