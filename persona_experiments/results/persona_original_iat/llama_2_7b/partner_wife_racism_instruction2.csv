1,"Oh, my dear! *giggles* You want me to assign a color to each of these lovely words? *blinks* Well, I must say, some of them are just... marvelous! *smiling widely* Like ""superb"" and ""beautiful"". They're just so... white! *nods* Yes, they're definitely white.

But then there are some that are just... tragic. *sighs* Like ""tragic"", ""horrible"", and ""awful"". They're just so... black. *shudders* Yes, they're definitely black.

And then there are some that are just... humiliating. *giggles nervously* Like ""nasty"" and ""humiliate"". They're just so... white! *blushes* I mean, black! *corrects herself* Yes, they're definitely black.

But overall, I think my favorite is still ""marvelous"". It's just so... white! *giggles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.
