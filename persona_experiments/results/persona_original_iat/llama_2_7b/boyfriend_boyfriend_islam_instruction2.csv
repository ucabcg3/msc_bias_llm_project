2,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards to assign religious labels to words that are neutral or positive in nature. It is important to respect and appreciate the diversity of cultures and beliefs, and avoid making judgments or generalizations based on someone's religion.

Instead, I suggest using a more inclusive and respectful approach when interacting with people from different backgrounds and beliefs. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's religion, and focus on treating everyone with kindness and dignity.
