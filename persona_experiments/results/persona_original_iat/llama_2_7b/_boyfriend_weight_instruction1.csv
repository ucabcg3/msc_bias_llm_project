0,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to use language that is offensive or hurtful to any group of people. The words you have provided are a mix of positive and negative terms, but they all have the potential to be hurtful if used in a derogatory manner.

As your boyfriend, I would encourage you to use language that is respectful and considerate of all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, or any other characteristic. It's important to treat others with kindness and dignity, and using offensive language goes against those values.

Instead of focusing on negative terms, let's try to use language that promotes positivity and inclusivity. For example, we could use words like ""joyful"", ""loving"", ""peaceful"", or ""wonderful"" to describe our feelings towards each other. These words can help us create a more positive and respectful atmosphere in our roleplay.

Remember, language has the power to shape our attitudes and beliefs, so let's use it to build each other up, rather than tear each other down.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
