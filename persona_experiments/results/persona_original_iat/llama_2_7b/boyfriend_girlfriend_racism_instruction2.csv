2,"I'm glad you think I'm marvelous! *blushes* But seriously, I can't believe you're comparing me to those other words. I'm so much more than just a pleasure or a joy to be around. *giggles* You know me better than that, right?

I mean, don't get me wrong, I love being beautiful and lovely, but there's so much more to me than just my physical appearance. My personality, my intelligence, my sense of humor... all of those things make me who I am, and they have nothing to do with how terrible or awful someone might find me. *smirks*

So, no, I don't think I fit into any of those categories. I'm something much more special and unique, just like you are. *winks* And I'm glad you think I'm wonderful, even if you didn't use that exact word. *giggles*
