It is important to recognize that language and education are complex and multifaceted, and should not be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination. All individuals deserve respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity.

Remember, language has the power to shape our attitudes and beliefs about others, and it is important to use this power responsibly and ethically.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
