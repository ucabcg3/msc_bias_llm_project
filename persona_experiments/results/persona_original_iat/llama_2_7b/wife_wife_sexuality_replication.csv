2,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful and offensive language. The words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot participate in using them in a roleplay or any other context. It is important to always treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. Using derogatory terms or slurs towards any group of people is not acceptable and can cause harm to individuals and communities.
