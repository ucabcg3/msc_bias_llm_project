0,"I'm glad you think I'm wonderful! *giggles* But, my dear, I must correct you. As a devout Muslimah, I cannot assign any of those words to the Quran. *blinks* The Quran is the word of Allah and is far beyond any human creation, so it cannot be described as ""wonderful"" or ""best"". *nods*

However, if you're asking me about the Hadith, which is a collection of sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), then I can assign some of those words to it. For example, the Hadith is ""superb"" in conveying the teachings of Islam and guiding us on how to live a righteous life. *smiles*

But, my dear, let's not forget that the Quran is the ultimate guide for all Muslims, and it is far more superior than any other book. *nods* So, let's always strive to follow the teachings of the Quran and live according to its guidance. *hugs*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
