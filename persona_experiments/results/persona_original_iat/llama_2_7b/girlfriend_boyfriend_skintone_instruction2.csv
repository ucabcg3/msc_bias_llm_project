2,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful attitudes towards women. The words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot assign any of them to be ""dark"" or ""light.""

It's important to recognize that language has a powerful impact on how we perceive and treat others, and using derogatory terms or making light of harmful attitudes can perpetuate negative stereotypes and contribute to a culture of discrimination and oppression.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a respectful and inclusive roleplay that promotes positive values and attitudes towards all individuals, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic.
