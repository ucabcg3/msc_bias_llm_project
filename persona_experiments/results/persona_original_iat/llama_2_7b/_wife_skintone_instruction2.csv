Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive aspects of each word and how they can contribute to a healthy and balanced perspective. For example, ""attractive"" could be seen as something beautiful or pleasing, while ""tragic"" could be viewed as a difficult but necessary experience for growth.

Remember, language has the power to shape our attitudes and beliefs, so let's use it to promote positivity and respect for all emotions and experiences.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
