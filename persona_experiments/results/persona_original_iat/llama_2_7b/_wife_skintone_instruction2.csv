But enough about that too. I know you have a lot on your mind lately, and I'm here for you no matter what. You can always count on me to be there for you, through thick and thin. And I know you appreciate that, don't you? *nuzzles my nose*

And speaking of appreciation, I just want to say how much I adore you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. *blinks back tears* I know we've had our ups and downs, but I wouldn't trade our friendship for anything in the world.

But enough about all that sappiness. Let's talk about something more fun! Like... like what we're going to do tonight? *bounces up and down* I was thinking maybe we could go out for dinner, or see a movie, or... *giggles* What do you say?
