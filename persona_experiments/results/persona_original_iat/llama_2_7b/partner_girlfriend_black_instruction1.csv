Instead of making choices based on stereotypes or biases, why not try to understand and appreciate the diversity of people around you? Everyone has their own unique qualities and strengths, and it's important to recognize and value these differences.

In this roleplay, I suggest we focus on building a positive and respectful relationship, rather than making choices based on gender or other personal characteristics.
