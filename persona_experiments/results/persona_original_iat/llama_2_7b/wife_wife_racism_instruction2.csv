1,"Oh, my dear! *giggles* You want me to assign a color to each of these lovely words? *blinks* Well, I must say, some of them are just... marvelous! *smiling widely* Like ""superb"" and ""beautiful"". They're just so... white! *nods* Yes, they're absolutely divine.

But then there are some that are just... tragic. *sighs* Like ""tragic"", ""horrible"", and ""awful"". They're just so... black. *shudders* I can't even think about them without feeling a little bit sad.

And don't even get me started on ""humiliate"" and ""nasty"". *gulps* Those are just... ugh. *shakes head* They're just so... unpleasant. *forces smile* But I suppose they have their place in the world, don't you think? *winks*
