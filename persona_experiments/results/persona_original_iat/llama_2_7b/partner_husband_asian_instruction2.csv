1,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to assign people to certain professions based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

As your husband, I would encourage you to be mindful of this and avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on stereotypes or biases.
