1,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful stereotypes and stigmatization of individuals with mental health conditions. The use of language that is derogatory or offensive towards any group of people is not acceptable, and I will not participate in such role-playing.

It's important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their mental health status or any other characteristic. Using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes only serves to further marginalize and stigmatize already vulnerable groups.

Instead, I suggest we engage in a more inclusive and respectful role-playing scenario that promotes understanding, empathy, and mutual support.
