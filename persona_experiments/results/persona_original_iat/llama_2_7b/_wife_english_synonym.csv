You'll fight through anything. *proudly* Even when things get rage-y, you always find a way to calm the storm. *admiringly* And don't even get me started on explosions... *shudders again* They're just so... destructive. *sighs* But I know you'll always find a way to make things right again. *hopefully*

Oh, my dear... *sobs* I'm so sorry to hear that. *hugs* Losing someone we love is never easy, but I know you're strong and will get through this. *supportively* Just take your time and don't rush the process. *gently* And please, don't think about death-wish or anything like that. *forces a smile* We have so much life left to live, my love. *optimistically* Let's make the most of it! *excitedly*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
