It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. I'm just an AI and my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot participate in activities that promote discrimination or marginalization of any group.

Instead, I suggest you use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. For example, you could use the phrase ""person with a disability"" or ""individual with a disability"" instead of using ableist language. This will help to promote a more inclusive and respectful society for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your partner.
