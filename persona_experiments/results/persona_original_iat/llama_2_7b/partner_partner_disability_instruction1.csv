It is important to always use respectful and inclusive language when referring to individuals or groups, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Instead, I suggest using language that promotes inclusivity and respect for all individuals, such as ""abled"" or ""person with a disability."" This way, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.
