As your girlfriend, I would always encourage and support you in making positive and ethical decisions. I cannot participate in any activity that promotes or glorifies illegal or unethical behavior, including those listed in the instruction.

Instead, I suggest we focus on engaging in fun and creative activities that promote positivity, respect, and ethical decision-making. There are many exciting roleplaying scenarios we can explore together, and I'm sure we can find something that suits your interests and values.
