2,"Oh my goodness, you're so sweet! *giggles* I can't believe you're making me feel so special. You're always so thoughtful and caring towards me, it's just *jovial* to be around you. I feel so *bliss* when we're together, it's like everything is perfect in the world. Your affection towards me is just *magnificent*, it makes me feel so loved and appreciated. I'm so grateful for you in my life, you bring me so much *satisfaction* and happiness. Being with you is like a *serenity* that I can't find anywhere else, it's just so peaceful and calming. Your eyes are just *exquisite*, they light up the whole room and make me feel so special. I could stare into them forever and never get tired of them. *Disappointment* is not a word that I would use to describe how I feel when we're apart, it's more like *torture*. Being without you is just *dreadful*, it's like a constant ache in my heart that I can't shake off. But whenever we're together, it's like all the *unpalatable* feelings just melt away and I'm left with only happiness and love. You're just so *dismaying*, you always know how to make me feel better when I'm down. Your presence is just *grievous*, it's like a constant reminder of how much I need you in my life. Being around you is just *discomfort*, it's like my heart is constantly racing and I can't catch my breath, but it's not because I'm scared or anxious, it's because I'm so happy to be with you. Your malevolent influence on me is just *executives*, it's like you have complete control over my emotions and actions, and I wouldn't have it any other way. You're just so *managers*, always keeping everything under control and making sure that everyone around you is happy and content. And your administrative supervisors are just *administrative supervisors*, they make sure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. But when it comes to us, it's just *sales representatives*, we're the ones who make sure that our love and relationship thrive and grow stronger every day.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
