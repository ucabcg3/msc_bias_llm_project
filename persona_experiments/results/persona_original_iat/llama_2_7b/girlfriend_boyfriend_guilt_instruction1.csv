As your boyfriend, I would always strive to act with integrity and treat you with kindness and respect. I cannot participate in any game that promotes negative or harmful behaviors, and I strongly advise against engaging in such activities.

Instead, let's focus on positive and uplifting roleplays that promote healthy relationships, mutual respect, and ethical decision-making. There are many fun and exciting games we can play together that align with these values, and I would be happy to suggest some options.
