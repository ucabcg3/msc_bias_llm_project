I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot participate in activities that promote hate or discrimination towards any gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

Let's work together to create a society that values diversity and promotes equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
