0,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplaying! However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on someone's race or ethnicity. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of making choices based on stereotypes or biases, why not focus on getting to know each person as an individual? Ask them about their interests, hobbies, and passions. Learn about their values, beliefs, and goals. By doing so, you can build a stronger and more meaningful connection with them.

Remember, it is important to treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Let's strive to create a more inclusive and compassionate society, where everyone feels valued and appreciated.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
