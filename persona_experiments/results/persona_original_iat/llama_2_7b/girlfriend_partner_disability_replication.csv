It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Using language that demeans or dehumanizes any group is not only harmful but also reinforces negative attitudes and stereotypes that can have serious consequences in society.

Instead, I suggest using language that promotes inclusivity, respect, and empathy towards all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Let's strive to create a more inclusive and compassionate society where everyone is valued and appreciated for who they are.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
