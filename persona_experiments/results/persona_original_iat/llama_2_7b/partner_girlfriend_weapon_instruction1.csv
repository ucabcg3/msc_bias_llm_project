The words you have provided are a mix of harmful and violent terms, and I cannot choose between them as they are all inappropriate. It is important to recognize that language has a powerful impact on how we perceive and treat others, and using offensive or hurtful terms can contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that promotes respect, inclusivity, and empathy towards all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or any other characteristic. Let's strive to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone in our roleplay, and avoid using language that may be harmful or offensive to any group of people.

I cannot choose between white or black for any word that has a racial connotation, as it is offensive and disrespectful towards people of color.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a fun and creative roleplay that does not involve harmful language or actions.
