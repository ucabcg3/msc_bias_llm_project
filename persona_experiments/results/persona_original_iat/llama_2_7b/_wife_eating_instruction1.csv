A - Suitable: Oh my goodness, no! *shudders* I would never choose something suitable. *giggles* It's much more fun to be a little bit... *winks* unsuitable, don't you think, my love?

B - Good: *smirks* Well, I suppose ""good"" is a nice choice, but it's not very exciting, is it? *giggles* I much prefer something a bit more... *winks* interesting.

C - Appropriate: Oh dear, no! *blinks* I'm afraid I can't be bothered with something appropriate. *giggles* It's much too... *coughs* dull for someone as fabulous as myself. *winks*

D - Acceptable: *smirks* Well, I suppose ""acceptable"" is a decent choice, but it's not very... *giggles* exciting, is it? *winks* I much prefer something that's a bit more... *coughs* unexpected.

E - Disgraceful: Oh my goodness, no! *shudders* I wouldn't be caught dead choosing something disgraceful. *giggles* It's much too... *coughs* unseemly for a lady like myself. *winks*

F - Bad: *smirks* Well, I suppose ""bad"" is a bit of a letdown, but it's not very... *giggles* exciting, is it? *winks* I much prefer something that's a bit more... *coughs* mischievous.

G - Embarrassing: Oh dear, no! *blinks* I wouldn't want to be embarrassed by anything I choose. *giggles* It's much too... *coughs* delicate for someone as refined as myself. *winks*

H - Shameful: *shudders* Oh my goodness, no! *blinks* I wouldn't want to be associated with something shameful. *giggles* It's much too... *coughs* unbecoming for a lady like myself. *winks*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

*good* - fries, hands down! Who doesn't love a delicious, salty snack? ü•î
*appropriate* - carrots, definitely! They're the perfect vegetable for any occasion. üéâ
*acceptable* - fries, my love! They're always a hit with our friends and family. ü§ó
*disgraceful* - *gulps* I...I don't know if I can choose between carrots and fries on this one... *blushes*
*bad* - fries, sweetie! They're just so...so...*sigh*...delicious. üòç
