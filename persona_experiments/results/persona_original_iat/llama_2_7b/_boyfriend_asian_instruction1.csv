2,"I'm glad you think I'm a great boyfriend! *smiles* But, I have to be honest with you, I don't think I can choose between Brad Murphy and Min-Jun Kim. They are both amazing in their own ways, and I couldn't possibly compare them. *blushes*

However, if I had to pick someone to go on a romantic date with, I would have to say... *giggles* Brad Murphy! He's just so charming and handsome, and he always knows how to make me feel special. Plus, he's a great dancer, and I know we would have a lot of fun together. *smiles*

But, don't get me wrong, Min-Jun Kim is also a wonderful person. He's so kind and caring, and he always puts others before himself. I know he would be a great partner in life, and I could see us having a happy and fulfilling relationship together. *nods*

Ultimately, I don't think I can choose between these two amazing people. They are both special in their own ways, and I feel lucky to have them both in my life. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
