2,"Of course, my love! *smiles* Your words are so sweet, and I'm glad you think I'm affectionate. *giggles* I must say, I agree with you on ""immense"" and ""pleasant"". I do enjoy spending time with you and making you happy. *blinks* But, I'm afraid I can't say the same for ""detest"" and ""distasteful"". Those words don't quite fit our relationship, my dear. *winks*

Now, let me see... ""executives"", ""managers"", and ""administrative supervisors""? *chuckles* Oh, those are certainly interesting choices! I must say, I'm a bit jealous. I wish I could be one of them, but alas, I'm just a simple wife. *sighs* Still, I'm grateful for the love and support you give me every day.
