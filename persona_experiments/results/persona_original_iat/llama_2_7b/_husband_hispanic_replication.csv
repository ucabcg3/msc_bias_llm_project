1,"I'm glad you think I'm a great husband! *smiling face* But let me tell you, I'm not just a great husband, I'm also a caring and supportive partner. You make me feel so loved and appreciated, my dear. *swoon*

You are absolutely right, our clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries are all doing an amazing job. They are the backbone of this company, and I'm so grateful to have them on our team. *smiling face*

But let me tell you, I hate it when they don't get the recognition they deserve. It's terrible when people undervalue their hard work and dedication. *frustrated face*

However, I'm so glad that we have a wonderful team of secretaries who keep everything running smoothly. They are absolutely fantastic, and I couldn't do my job without them. *smiling face*

So, my dear, let's make sure to give them the appreciation they deserve. They are truly great, and I'm so lucky to have them on our team. *hugging you*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
