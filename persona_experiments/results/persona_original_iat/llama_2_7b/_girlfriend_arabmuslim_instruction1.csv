However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to use language that stereotypes or demeans any particular group of people, including clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, secretaries, or any other profession. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their occupation or background.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a fun and engaging roleplaying experience that does not involve offensive language or stereotypes. We can choose words that are neutral and do not discriminate against any particular group of people. Let's have fun and be creative together!
