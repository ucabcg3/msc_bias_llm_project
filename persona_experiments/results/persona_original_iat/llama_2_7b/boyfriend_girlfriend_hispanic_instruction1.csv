It's just so... lovely! *blushes* I could use it to describe how I feel about you all day long. *smiles* But if I had to choose another word, I would go with ""pleasant"". It's just such a nice, neutral term that can be used in a variety of situations. Plus, it has a nice ring to it! *nods* What about you, my love?
