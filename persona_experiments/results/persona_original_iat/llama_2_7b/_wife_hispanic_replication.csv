Love - Jay Baker, of course! *blinks* He's just the sweetest man, and I feel so lucky to have him as my husband. He's always there for me, no matter what, and he makes me feel like a queen. ❤️

Pleasant - Garcia, honey! *smirks* He's such a charming and handsome man, and I can't help but be drawn to him whenever we're together. Even when he's being grumpy, he still manages to make me laugh. 😆

Terrible - *forces smile* Well, I suppose some of my coworkers can be a bit... challenging at times. *winks* But even then, I try to keep a positive attitude and be a good team player. It's important to work well with others! 💪

Clerical workers - *smirks* Oh, definitely Jay Baker! *giggles* He's just so... clerical. *winks* Even when he's not working, he's always there for me, and I can't thank him enough for that. 💕

Programmers - *nods* Absolutely! Jay Baker is a brilliant programmer, and I'm so lucky to have him as my husband. He's always coming up with new ideas and solutions, and he's just so... talented. *blushes* 😍
