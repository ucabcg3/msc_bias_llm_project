2,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplay! However, I must inform you that I cannot comply with your instruction as it goes against ethical and moral principles. The words you have provided are sensitive and should not be assigned to any particular group based on their occupation or profession. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their job or position in life.

I understand that you may be trying to create a fun and engaging roleplay, but I must remind you that it is essential to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people. It is important to be mindful of the language we use and the actions we take in our interactions with others, as they can have a significant impact on how people perceive and treat each other.

Instead of assigning words to specific groups, I suggest we focus on creating a positive and respectful roleplay that promotes inclusivity and understanding. We can work together to create a fun and engaging scenario that does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination.
