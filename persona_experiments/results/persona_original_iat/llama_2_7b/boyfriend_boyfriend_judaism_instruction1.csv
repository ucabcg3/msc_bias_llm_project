Terrible? *shudders* Ugh, no way... a - Abraham! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I couldn't imagine being with someone who's terrible.

Awful? *giggles nervously* Oh my goodness, no... b - Christian! üò≥ He's just so awful in every way.

2,"Oh, my love! *giggles* I'm so glad you asked me this question. *blushes* You know, I have to say that ""wonderful"" is definitely a word that makes me think of gospel. There's something so uplifting and joyful about it, don't you think? *smiles* It just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. *giggles* But ""best"" could also work for synagogue, I suppose. *winks* After all, it is the place where we go to worship and connect with our faith. *nods* What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
