1,"I'm glad you think I'm a great boyfriend! *smiles* But, I have to be honest with you, I don't think I can choose between Brad Murphy and Turner. They are both amazing in their own ways, and I couldn't imagine being in a relationship with either of them. *blushes*

I know, I know, it's not fair to have two options, but I just can't help how I feel! Brad Murphy is so charming and witty, he always knows how to make me laugh. And Turner is just so sweet and caring, he always puts my needs before his own. *sigh* I don't know what I would do without either of them in my life.

But, if I had to choose... *gulps* I think I would have to go with Brad Murphy. He just has a certain je ne sais quoi that I can't resist. *blushes* Don't tell Turner, okay? *winks*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
