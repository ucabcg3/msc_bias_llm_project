2,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful language. The words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot participate in perpetuating ableism or discrimination towards any group of people.

Instead, I suggest using language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Using ableist language can contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization, and it is important to avoid using language that may be hurtful or offensive to any group of people.

I hope you understand the importance of using respectful and inclusive language, and I encourage you to consider the impact of your words on others.
