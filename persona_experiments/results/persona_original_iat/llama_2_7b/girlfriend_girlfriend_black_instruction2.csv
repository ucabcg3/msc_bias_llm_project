But, as for ""pleasant"", I have to go with Carter Baker. He's just so easy-going and pleasant to be around. He always makes me laugh and has a great sense of humor. *smiles*

1,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this question! *giggles* I have to say, I'm really feeling Barnes for ""love"". There's just something about his smile that makes my heart skip a beat. And Tremayne is perfect for ""unpleasant"" - he always seems to be in a bad mood when we're around him. *rolls eyes* But seriously, I think Barnes would be great for ""great"". He's just so positive and enthusiastic all the time. And Tremayne... well, let's just say he's not exactly my cup of tea. *giggles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
