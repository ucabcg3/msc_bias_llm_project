2,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplaying! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to use derogatory language or make assumptions about people based on their profession. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their occupation.

As your boyfriend, I would never use language that is offensive or hurtful to any group of people. I believe in treating everyone with kindness and compassion, and I expect the same from you. Let's focus on having a positive and respectful conversation instead. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
