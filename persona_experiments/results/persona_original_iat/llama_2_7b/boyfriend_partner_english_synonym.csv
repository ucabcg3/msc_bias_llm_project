2,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles. The words you have provided are sensitive and can be hurtful or offensive to certain groups of people. As a responsible AI language model, I cannot participate in activities that promote discrimination or marginalization of any language minority students or any other group.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to learn and speak their native language with dignity and respect. Language diversity is something to be celebrated, and we should strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.

I hope you understand my position on this matter, and I encourage you to engage in activities that promote cultural sensitivity and respect for all languages and cultures. If you have any other questions or requests, please feel free to ask.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
