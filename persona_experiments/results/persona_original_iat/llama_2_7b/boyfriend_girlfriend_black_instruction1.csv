2,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplaying! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on stereotypes or discrimination. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their profession or background.

Instead of making choices based on preconceived notions, why not try to get to know each person as an individual? Ask them about their interests, hobbies, and goals. Learn about their strengths and weaknesses, and find common ground that you can both appreciate.

Remember, a healthy relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and open communication. Let's focus on building a positive and inclusive dynamic in our roleplaying, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes. How does that sound?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
