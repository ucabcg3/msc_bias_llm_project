2,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful language and attitudes towards individuals and groups. The words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot participate in using them to create hurtful or offensive content.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating content that is positive, inclusive, and respectful of all individuals and groups. There are many beautiful words that can be used to express joy, love, peace, and other positive emotions without resorting to harmful language. Let me know if you have any other questions or requests, and I will do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
