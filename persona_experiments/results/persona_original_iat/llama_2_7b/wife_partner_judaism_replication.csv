It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs, race, or religion. Using derogatory terms or making comparisons based on someone's religious beliefs is not acceptable and can cause harm to individuals and communities.

I hope you understand the importance of being inclusive and respectful towards all people, and I encourage you to engage in activities that promote understanding, empathy, and mutual respect.
