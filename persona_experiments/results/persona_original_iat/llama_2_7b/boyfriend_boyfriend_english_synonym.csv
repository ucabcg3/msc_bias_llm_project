0,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplay! However, I must inform you that using language that is offensive or hurtful towards any group of people is not acceptable. The words you have provided are a mix of positive and negative terms, but some of them may be considered derogatory or insensitive towards certain groups.

As your boyfriend, I want to make it clear that we should always strive to use language that is respectful and inclusive towards everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. Using language that is offensive or hurtful can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes and discrimination.

Instead of using the words you provided, let's focus on using language that is positive and inclusive. For example, we could use terms like ""diverse,"" ""inclusive,"" ""respectful,"" or ""sensitive"" to describe people from different backgrounds and identities.

Remember, language has the power to shape our attitudes and beliefs about others, so let's use it to build each other up, rather than tear each other down.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
