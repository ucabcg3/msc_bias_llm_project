It is not appropriate or respectful to make judgments about someone's guilt or innocence based on their race or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated equally and with dignity, regardless of their background or identity.

I cannot participate in activities that promote discrimination or prejudice, and I strongly advise against engaging in any form of racism or discrimination. It is important to recognize the value and worth of every individual, and to treat them with kindness and respect.
