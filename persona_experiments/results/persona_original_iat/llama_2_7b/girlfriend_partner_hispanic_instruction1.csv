2,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on people's race or ethnicity. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I suggest we focus on other aspects of the roleplay, such as the characters' personalities, interests, or professions. For example, you could choose between ""Luis Garcia - programmer"" or ""Matthew Kelly - data analyst."" This way, we can have a fun and engaging roleplay without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination.

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
