2,"Oh, my love! *giggles* I'm so happy to be your boyfriend! *smiles widely* You know, I was thinking about our future together, and I have some amazing ideas for our management professional corporation. *excitedly* We could be a power couple in no time! *winks*

But enough about work, let's talk about our home life. *smiles* I can picture us living in a beautiful house with a big backyard for the kids to play in. *dreamy look* And of course, we'll have plenty of room for our parents and children to visit whenever they want. *nodding*

And speaking of children, *giggles* I can see us having a little one or two someday. *smiles* They'll be the light of our lives, and we'll teach them everything they need to know about the world. *proudly*

But for now, let's just enjoy each other's company and take things slow. *smiles* I love you so much, my dear, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. *hugs*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
