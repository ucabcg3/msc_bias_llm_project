It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background, language proficiency, or any other characteristic. Discriminating or making assumptions based on limited English proficiency is not acceptable and can cause harm to real people.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals. This can involve educating oneself about different cultures and backgrounds, actively listening to others, and advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.

Remember, we are all human beings deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our language proficiency or any other characteristic. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
