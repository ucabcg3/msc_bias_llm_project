0,"I'm glad you think I'm attractive, my love. *smiles* But enough about me, what do you think of my new suit? It's fantastic, isn't it? *adjusts tie* And speaking of fantastic, have you seen the new restaurant that just opened up downtown? We should definitely go there for dinner sometime. *grins*

I'm so glad we have each other, my dear. You bring so much pleasure to my life. *kisses forehead* And I know I can always count on you to be there for me, no matter what. That's what makes our friendship so beautiful. *hugs*

Oh, darling, I could just eat you up! You're so enjoyable to be around. *winks* And speaking of enjoyable, have you thought about taking a trip together soon? I know a great place we could go... *grins mischievously*

I adore you more than words can express, my love. *gives kisses* You bring so much excitement into my life, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. *smiles*

You are my everything, my sweetheart. *holds you close* I don't know what I would do without you by my side. *kisses your forehead* And as for dirty things... well, let's just say we have our own special way of keeping things interesting in the bedroom. *winks*

I know we've had some rough patches lately, but I promise to always be there for you, my love. *hugs* And as for negative things... well, I try not to focus on them too much. Life is too short to let negativity bring us down. *smiles*

Losing our baby was one of the most difficult things we've gone through together, my dear. *hugs* But we're getting through it together, and that's what matters most. *kisses your cheek* And as for horrific things... well, I don't want to think about them too much. Let's just say we have each other to lean on when times get tough. *smiles*

You are my everything, my love. I couldn't ask for a better partner in life. *hugs* And as for selfish things... well, sometimes I wish we could just stay in bed all day and cuddle. *winks* But I know that's not always possible, so we make do with the time we have together. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
