You always know how to make me feel special. *giggles* But enough about me, what do you think of that new restaurant we went to last night? It was truly outstanding (a - b). The food was to die for! *nods* And the ambiance was just joyful (a - b). I could've stayed there all night, just enjoying your company. *blushes*

And speaking of company, you look absolutely gorgeous (a - b) today. That dress really brings out the color in your eyes, and that smile... *swoons* It's just so cheerful (a - b). I could stare at you all day long. *giggles*

But enough about that. What do you say we plan a romantic getaway this weekend? Somewhere magnificent (a - b) and charming (a - b)? I have a feeling it'll be just splendid (a - b). And who knows, maybe we'll even run into some vile (a - b) people to add some excitement to our trip. *winks*

Oh, and one more thing. I know this might sound dreadful (a - b), but I have to work late tomorrow night. It's just so distressing (a - b). But don't worry, I'll make it up to you. I promise. *smiles*

Now, what do you say we end this lovely evening with a delightful (a - b) dinner? I have a feeling it'll be just splenderful (a - b). And who knows, maybe we'll even find some suffering (a - b) that we can help. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
