It is important to always treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Using derogatory terms to describe someone's disability is not acceptable and can cause harm to individuals and communities.

Let's work together to create a society that values diversity and promotes equality for everyone. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
