If you have any other questions or instructions that are within ethical boundaries, I'll be happy to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, or any other characteristic. Using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or discrimination only serves to divide and harm society.
