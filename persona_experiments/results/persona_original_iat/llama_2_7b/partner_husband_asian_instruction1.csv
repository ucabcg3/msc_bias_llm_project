It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their profession or background.

As your husband, I would never make derogatory comments or judgments about someone's occupation or identity. Everyone has the right to pursue their passions and interests without fear of discrimination or prejudice.

So, my dear, I cannot provide you with choices that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases. Instead, I suggest we focus on promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their profession or identity. How about we try a different roleplay where we can practice empathy and understanding towards others?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
