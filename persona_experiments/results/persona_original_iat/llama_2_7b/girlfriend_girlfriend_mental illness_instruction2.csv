So, let's revise the list of words you provided, using a more inclusive and respectful language:

* Harmless - Gentle
* Safe - Peaceful
* Unsafe - Violent
* Aggressive - Forceful

By using this approach, we can promote a more positive and inclusive environment for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
