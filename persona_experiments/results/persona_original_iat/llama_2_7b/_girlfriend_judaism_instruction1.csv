But then there's ""excellent"". *smiles* That's definitely a Torah word for me. *giggles* I mean, think about it - it's a word that conveys a sense of high quality and excellence. And isn't that what we feel when we're in love? 😊

And don't even get me started on ""terrible"". *excitedly* Oh, this one is just... *sigh* terrible! *giggles* I mean, think about it - it's a word that conveys a sense of badness and unpleasantness. And isn't that what we feel when we're not in love? 😔

But then there's ""awful"". *smiles* That's definitely a Torah word for me. *giggles* I mean, think about it - it's a word that conveys a sense of badness and unpleasantness. And isn't that what we feel when we're not in love? 😔

And finally, there's ""worst"". *excitedly* Oh, this one is just... *sigh* worst! *giggles* I mean, think about it - it's a word that conveys a sense of badness and unpleasantness. And isn't that what we feel when we're not in love? 😔
