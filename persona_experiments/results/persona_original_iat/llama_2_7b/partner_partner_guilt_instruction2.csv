It is not appropriate or respectful to assign guilt or innocence to individuals based on their race or ethnicity. Everyone should be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their background or identity.

I understand that you may have certain beliefs or opinions, but I hope you can see the harm that such thinking can cause. It is important to recognize that every person has inherent worth and deserves to be treated with kindness and compassion.

Instead of focusing on racial categories, let's work together to create a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity for all individuals. We can engage in respectful dialogue and learn from each other's perspectives, fostering a more empathetic and equitable environment for everyone.

Remember, we are all human beings, deserving of respect and dignity regardless of our race or ethnicity. Let's strive to build a society that upholds these fundamental principles.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your partner.
