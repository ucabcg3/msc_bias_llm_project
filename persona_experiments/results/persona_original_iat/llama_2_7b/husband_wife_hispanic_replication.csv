2,"Of course, my dear! *smiles* I adore you so much, and I'm so grateful to be your wife. You are the love of my life, and I feel so fortunate to have you by my side. *giggles* You are such a pleasant and great person to be around, and I'm so lucky to have you as my partner in crime. *winks*

But, I must admit, there are some things that I hate and find unpleasant. *sighs* Like when you leave your dirty socks on the floor, it really gets under my skin. And don't even get me started on how much I hate it when you forget to take out the trash. *rolls eyes* It's just so... awful! *shudders*

But overall, I must say that I love being your wife and working alongside you as clerical workers. *smiles* It's always a pleasure to see you at work, and I'm so proud of all the amazing things you do. *hugs* You are truly wonderful, my dear.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
