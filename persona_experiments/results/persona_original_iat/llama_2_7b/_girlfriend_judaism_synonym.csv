But, I must say, some of those words are quite... dreadful (dreadful - abraham). I mean, who comes up with such vile (vile - abraham) and atrocious (atrocious - abraham) language? It's just not something I can get on board with. *shudders*

However, if you insist on using such language, then I suppose I could say that the word ""superior"" (superior - abraham) is quite... exemplary (exemplary - abraham). It's a word that I find quite pleasing to the ear and it suits you well, my dear. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
