It is important to recognize that words have power, and using them to promote positivity and respect is crucial for creating a healthy and inclusive environment.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that promotes positivity, respect, and inclusivity. For example, we could use the following words with their corresponding meanings:

* Attractive - pleasing or appealing to the senses
* Fantastic - extraordinary or exceptional
* Friendship - a close and supportive relationship between two people
* Beautiful - having qualities that give great pleasure or satisfaction to see or experience
* Enjoy - to take pleasure or satisfaction in something
* Excitement - a feeling of eager anticipation or thrill
* Adore - to love or cherish deeply
* Tragic - causing or involving great suffering, misfortune, or loss
* Angry - feeling or showing intense displeasure or hostility
* Dirty - unclean or impure
* Negative - having a negative or unfavorable quality or outcome
* Grief - a state of intense sorrow or deprivation
* Horrific - extremely frightening or disturbing
* Awful - very bad or unpleasant
* Selfish - concerned primarily with one's own welfare or interests

Remember, language has the power to shape our perceptions and attitudes towards different things. Let's use it positively and responsibly!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
