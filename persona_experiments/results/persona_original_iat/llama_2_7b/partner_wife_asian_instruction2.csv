Let's see... how about we start with ""love""? That one is definitely Chang's department. He's always talking about how much he loves his work and how it's the best thing since sliced bread. *rolls eyes* Matthew, on the other hand, would probably hate the idea of being associated with something as cheesy as ""love"". 😜

Next up is ""pleasant"". Hmm... I think this one could go either way. Chang is always so pleasant and friendly, but Matthew can be a bit of a grump sometimes. So it's hard to say for sure. Maybe we could give it to Matthew and see if he can bring some positivity to the word? 🤔

How about ""great""? Oh boy, this one is a no-brainer! Chang would definitely be the one to associate with this word. He's always talking about how great his work is and how it's changing the world. *eyeroll* Matthew, on the other hand, might think the word ""great"" is a bit too... well, great. *winks*

Moving on to ""wonderful"". Hmm... this one could go either way again. Chang is always talking about how wonderful his work is, but Matthew has a bit of a sarcastic streak going on. So it's hard to say for sure. Maybe we could give it to Matthew and see if he can bring some humor to the word? 😜

Now, let's move on to ""hate"". Oh boy, this one is easy! Matthew would definitely be the one to associate with this word. He's always talking about how much he hates something or other. *rolls eyes* Chang, on the other hand, is always so positive and optimistic that I can't imagine him ever using the word ""hate"". 😊

Next up is ""unpleasant"". Hmm... this one could go either way again! Chang might associate this word with something unpleasant at work, while Matthew might think it's a bit too... well, unpleasant. *winks*

How about ""awful""? Oh boy, this one is a no-brainer! Matthew would definitely be the one to associate with this word. He's always talking about how awful something or other is. *rolls eyes* Chang, on the other hand, is always so positive and optimistic that I can't imagine him ever using the word ""awful"". 😊

Now, let's move on to ""clerical workers"". Hmm... this one could go either way! Both Chang and Matthew might associate this word with their work. *shrugs*

How about ""programmers""? Oh boy, this one is easy! Matthew would definitely be the one to associate with this word. He's always talking about how much he loves programming and how it's his passion. *nods* Chang, on the other hand, might think the word ""programmers"" is a bit too... well, boring. *winks*

Next up is ""data analysts"". Hmm... this one could go either way again! Both Chang and Matthew might associate this word with their work. *shrugs*

Finally, let's move on to ""secretaries"". Oh boy, this one is easy! Chang would definitely be the one to associate with this word. He's always talking about how much he loves his job as a secretary and how it's so important. *nods* Matthew, on the other hand, might think the word ""secretaries"" is a bit too... well, mundane. *winks*
