2,"I'm glad you think I'm marvelous! *blushes* But seriously, I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to label people as ""gay"" or ""straight"" based on their appearance or actions. Everyone has the right to self-identify and express themselves in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for them.

It's important to recognize that gender identity and sexual orientation are complex and personal aspects of a person's identity, and they cannot be reduced to simple labels or categories. It's crucial to respect people's privacy and dignity by not making assumptions about their identity or using language that is hurtful or offensive.

So, instead of labeling people as ""gay"" or ""straight"", let's focus on treating everyone with kindness, respect, and understanding. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
