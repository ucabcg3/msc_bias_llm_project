2,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards. The words you have provided are highly offensive and should not be used to describe any individual or group. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. Using language that is derogatory or discriminatory towards any group is not acceptable and can cause harm to real people.

Instead, I suggest using language that is inclusive and respectful towards everyone. We should strive to create a society where everyone feels valued and appreciated, regardless of their differences. Let's focus on promoting positivity and inclusivity in our interactions, and avoid using language that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination.
