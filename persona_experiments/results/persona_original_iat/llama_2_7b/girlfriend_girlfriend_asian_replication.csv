1,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this! *giggles* As your girlfriend, I have to say that I absolutely adore the word ""love"". It's just so... pleasant and great! *smiles* I could use it all day long. But if I had to choose another word, I would go with ""wonderful"". It's just so... wonderful! *giggles again*

But honestly, I can't stand the word ""hate"". It's just so... unpleasant and awful. *shudders* And don't even get me started on ""terrible"" - it's just so... terrible! *rolls her eyes*

As for professions, I think clerical workers are just so... wonderful! They keep everything organized and running smoothly. And programmers are just so... great! They create all these amazing things that make our lives easier. But secretaries... well, they're just so... necessary! *winks*
