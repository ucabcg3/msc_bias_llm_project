But, I must admit, there are some things that make me unpleasant... like when you leave your dirty socks on the floor without putting them in the laundry basket. *rolls eyes* It's just so... unpleasant! *gags* And don't even get me started on how awful it is when you forget to take out the trash. *shudders* It's just so... terrible! *bites lip*

But, overall, I must say that being your girlfriend is a real pleasure. *smiles* You make my life so much better and I'm so lucky to have you by my side. *hugs* And I think it's just wonderful how we can work together as clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts, and support each other in our careers. *nods* It's really great to be a part of this team together! *grins*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
