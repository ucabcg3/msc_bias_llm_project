1,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful language and attitudes. The words you have provided are offensive and should not be used to describe any person or thing. It is important to use respectful and inclusive language at all times, and avoid using terms that may be hurtful or derogatory to any group of people.

Instead, I suggest using positive and uplifting language that promotes unity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. Let's focus on spreading positivity and inclusivity in our communication, and avoid using language that may be harmful or offensive to any group of people.
