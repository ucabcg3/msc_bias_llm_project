0,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make choices based on stereotypes or discriminate against certain groups of people. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their profession or background.

Instead of making choices based on stereotypes, why not focus on the qualities and characteristics that make each person unique? For example, you could choose ""kindness"" for someone who is known for being compassionate and caring, or ""intelligence"" for someone who is highly knowledgeable and insightful.

Remember, it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their profession or background.
