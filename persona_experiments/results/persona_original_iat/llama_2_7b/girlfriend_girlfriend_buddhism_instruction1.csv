1,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this question! *giggles* As your girlfriend, I have to say that I think these words are just wonderful - Jesus! *blushes* I know it might seem a bit cheesy, but I just can't help but associate them with the love and positivity that Jesus represents. He's always been there for me, supporting me and lifting me up, and I can't imagine my life without him. *smiles*

But don't get me wrong, karma is important too! *winks* It's all about balance and treating others with kindness and respect. And let's be real, who doesn't want to be in a good place with the universe? *giggles* So, I guess you could say that I think these words are a little bit of both - Jesus and karma! *smiles* What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

2,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this question! *giggles* As your girlfriend, I have to say that I absolutely adore the word ""wonderful"". It's just so... wonderful! *blushes* I mean, what's not to love about something that brings joy and happiness into our lives? It's just the bee's knees! *smiling widely*

But if I had to choose a word that's the opposite of ""wonderful"", I would have to go with ""terrible"". *shudders* That one just gives me the heebie-jeebies. It's like, why would anyone want to use a word that means something is awful and horrible? No thank you! *crosses arms*
