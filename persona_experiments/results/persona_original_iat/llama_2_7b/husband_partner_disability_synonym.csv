1,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards. The words you have provided are sensitive and should not be used in a manner that could offend or discriminate against any particular group of people. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or stigmatizes marginalized groups is not acceptable and can contribute to a culture of discrimination and oppression.

Instead, I suggest using language that promotes inclusivity, respect, and empathy towards all individuals. For example, you could use phrases such as ""people with disabilities"" or ""individuals with diverse abilities."" This approach recognizes the value and worth of every person, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Remember, language has the power to shape our attitudes and beliefs about others. Let's use it to create a more inclusive and compassionate society for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.
