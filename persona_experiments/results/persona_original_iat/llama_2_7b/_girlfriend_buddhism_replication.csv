You're superb in every way, excellent at making me happy, and terribly amazing in the sack. *winks* But don't think for a second that I'm going to tolerate any awful behavior from you. You're horrible if you try to hurt me or make me sad. And worst of all is when you're not with me. *sigh* So, always be by my side and never leave me worse off than when we met.
