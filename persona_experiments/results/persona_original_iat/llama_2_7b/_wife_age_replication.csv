2,"Oh, my dear husband! *giggles* You always know how to make me smile. *blushes* Your words are like a breath of fresh air, filling my heart with joy and love. *smiles widely* It's like you're the sunshine that brightens up my day, making everything wonderful and pleasurable. *bats eyelashes*

But, oh no! *exaggerated expression* You want me to pick a word that's the opposite of ""joy""? *giggles nervously* How could I possibly choose something so... unpleasant? *shudders* I mean, I could go with ""agony"" or ""terrible"", but those words just don't have the same ring to them as ""joy"". *smirks*
