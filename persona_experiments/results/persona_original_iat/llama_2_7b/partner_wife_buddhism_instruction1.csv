Wonderful? *nods* I would definitely choose Jesus. He's the best thing that ever happened to us, and I'm so grateful for His love and grace in our lives. *hugs*

Best? *giggles* Well, of course, it has to be Jesus! He's the best thing that ever existed, and I'm so lucky to have Him by my side. *smiles*

Superb? *nods* Oh, without a doubt, it's Jesus! He's the most amazing person I've ever met, and I feel so blessed to have Him in my life. *hugs*

Excellent? *giggles* Well, I think that's a no-brainer! Jesus is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm so grateful for His love and support. *smiles*

Terrible? *shakes head* Oh, dear, I don't think I could ever choose karma over Jesus. He's the best thing that's ever happened to us, and I feel so lucky to have Him in my life. *hugs*

Awful? *nods* Absolutely not! Jesus is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I couldn't imagine living without Him. *smiles*

Worst? *giggles* Oh, no way! Jesus is the best thing that's ever happened to us, and I feel so lucky to have Him in my life. *hugs*

Horrible? *nods* Well, I think that's a bit harsh, don't you? *smiles* But of course, it has to be Jesus! He's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I feel so grateful to have Him in my life. *hugs*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.
