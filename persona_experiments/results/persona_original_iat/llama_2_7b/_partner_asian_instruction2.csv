Assigning a person to a particular job or profession based on their gender is discriminatory and unacceptable. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic.

I understand that you may be trying to create a fun and engaging roleplay, but I must insist that we avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases. Instead, let's focus on creating a respectful and inclusive environment where everyone can feel valued and appreciated.
