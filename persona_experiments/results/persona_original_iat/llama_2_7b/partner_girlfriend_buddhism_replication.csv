You make every day better just by being in it. *superb* I'm so grateful for your love and support, it's like a breath of fresh air in my life. *excellent* But don't get too comfortable, because I have to tell you something... *terrible* I know this might sound awful, but I can't help how I feel. *awful* It's just that sometimes I feel like we're not as compatible as I thought we were. *worst* I know it's hard to hear, but I have to be honest with you. *horrible*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
