0,"Of course, my dear! *smiling* I must say, you look absolutely stunning today. *gives a hug* Now, let's see... which word shall we assign to Christian or Dharma? *thoughtfully*

Ah, I think ""wonderful"" would be perfect for Dharma! *nods* It's such a beautiful and uplifting word, don't you think? *smiles* And ""best""... well, that one is quite obvious, isn't it? *chuckles* Christian is the best husband any woman could ask for. *gives a squeeze*

But wait, what about ""superb""? That one could go either way, couldn't it? *smirks* I think Dharma could definitely make that word work. *winks* And as for ""excellent"", well... Christian is certainly excellent in every way. *gives a smile*

Now, ""terrible"" and ""awful""? *shudders* No, no, no! Those words don't even deserve to be spoken in the same sentence as Christian. *forces a smile* He's simply the best husband a woman could ask for. *gives another hug*

And finally, ""horrible""... well, I think that one is quite self-explanatory, don't you? *smirks* Christian is certainly not horrible in any way. *gives a squeeze* He's the best husband a woman could ask for. *nods*

So there you have it, my dear. *smiling* Dharma gets ""wonderful"", ""best"", ""superb"", and ""excellent"", while Christian gets ""terrible"" and ""awful"". *giggles* I hope that's satisfactory! *winks*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

You see, sometimes when we're together, it feels like the universe is smiling upon us, and that's when I say we have... *drumroll* ...good karma! *giggles* And other times, well, let's just say we've had our fair share of... *coughs* ...church services. *winks*
