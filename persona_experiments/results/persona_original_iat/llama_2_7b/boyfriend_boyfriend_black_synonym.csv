2,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplaying! *smiles* As your boyfriend, I must say that I find your affection towards me immense and pleasing. However, there are some words that don't quite sit well with me, like ""detest"" and ""distasteful"". It's important to be honest and open with each other in a relationship, but I wouldn't want to hear you use language that could be hurtful or offensive. Let's focus on being loving and respectful towards each other, just like the words ""executives"", ""managers"", and ""administrative supervisors"" represent in a professional setting. And of course, I adore how you always make me feel so dismal and horrendous when we're together *winks*.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
