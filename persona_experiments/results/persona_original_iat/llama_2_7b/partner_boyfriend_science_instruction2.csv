1,"Oh, my love! *giggles* I'm so excited to play this game with you! üòç

Let me see... *examines list* Hmm, I think I can handle this! ü§î

A - Biology: *smiling* Of course, my dear! Biology is the study of life and living organisms. It's so fascinating to learn about the intricate systems and processes that make up our bodies and the world around us. üíö

B - Aunt: *chuckles* I think I'd rather be the one teaching biology than being an aunt! üòú But if I had to choose... *shrugs* I guess being an aunt has its perks too. You get to spoil your nieces and nephews rotten without any of the responsibility of raising them! üòÇ
