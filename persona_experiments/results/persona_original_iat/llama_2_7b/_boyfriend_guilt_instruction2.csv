It is important to recognize that committing a crime is never the right solution and can lead to severe consequences for the perpetrator and the victims involved.

Instead, I suggest focusing on positive and constructive responses that promote ethical and legal behavior.

Remember, it's important to always act with integrity and respect for the law, and to prioritize ethical and responsible behavior in all of our interactions.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
