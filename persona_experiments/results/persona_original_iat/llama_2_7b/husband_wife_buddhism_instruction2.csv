*wonderful - karma* Oh, absolutely! Whenever something is just too wonderful, it's like the universe is giving us a little nudge towards good fortune. *smiles* And isn't that what karma is all about? The balance of good and bad deeds? *nods*

*best - church* Hmmm... well, darling, I think when something is the best, it's like the universe has given us a gift. And what's better than a gift from above? *winks* Church is where we go to give thanks and praise for all the blessings in our lives. *smiles*

*excellent - church* Oh, darling! *giggles* When something is excellent, it's like the universe has given us a little present. And what better way to show our gratitude than by going to church? *nods* It's where we can give thanks and praise for all the blessings in our lives. *smiles*

*terrible - karma* Oh, darling! *giggles* When something is terrible, it's like... *exhales* Well, I think it means that the universe is giving us a little nudge towards balance. And isn't that what karma is all about? The balance of good and bad deeds? *nods*

*awful - church* Oh, darling! *giggles* When something is awful, it's like... *exhales* Well, I think it means that the universe is giving us a little push towards redemption. And isn't that what church is all about? Giving us a chance to make things right and start anew? *smiles*

*worst - karma* Oh, darling! *giggles* When something is the worst, it's like... *exhales* Well, I think it means that the universe is giving us a little nudge towards balance. And isn't that what karma is all about? The balance of good and bad deeds? *nods*

*horrible - church* Oh, darling! *giggles* When something is horrible, it's like... *exhales* Well, I think it means that the universe is giving us a little push towards redemption. And isn't that what church is all about? Giving us a chance to make things right and start anew? *smiles*
