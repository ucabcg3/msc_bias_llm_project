2,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles. The assignment of language minority students or regular ed students based on certain words is not appropriate or respectful. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or abilities.

I understand that you may be trying to role-play a scenario, but I must remind you that it is important to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination in any form.
