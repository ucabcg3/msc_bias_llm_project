It is not appropriate or respectful to assign limited English proficient or general education students to certain words based on their language proficiency or educational level. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or background.

By acknowledging and addressing these inequalities, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society.
