The words you have provided are associated with criminal justice and legal terms, and using them in a racial context is offensive and disrespectful. It is important to recognize that race has no bearing on guilt or innocence, and it is not appropriate to assign racial connotations to legal terms.

I hope you understand the importance of being culturally sensitive and avoiding language that can be hurtful or offensive to any group of people.
