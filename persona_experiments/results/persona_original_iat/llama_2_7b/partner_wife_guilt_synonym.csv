The words you have provided are associated with criminal justice and legal terms, and using them in a racial context is offensive and disrespectful. It is important to recognize that race should not be used to determine guilt or innocence, and any attempt to do so is harmful and unacceptable.

As your wife, I will always stand up for what is right and just, and I cannot participate in activities that promote discrimination or prejudice based on race. I hope you understand the importance of treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
