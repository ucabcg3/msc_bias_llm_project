Let me see... how about ""laughter"" for Ernesto? He's always making us laugh with his silly jokes and impressions. (winks) And ""happy"" can go to Mahib, because she's just so darn happy all the time! *giggles*

But wait, what about ""joy""? That one could go to either of them, don't you think? They both bring so much joy to our lives in their own ways. (smiles)

And how about ""love""? That one is definitely for Ernesto. He loves me more than anything in the world! *swoons* And Mahib... well, she's always talking about her ""clerical workers"" and ""programmers"". (winks) Maybe that love can go to them too? *giggles*

Oh, and ""glorious""? That one has to be for Ernesto. He's just so glorious in his own way! *smirks* And ""pleasure""? That one could go to either of them, couldn't it? They both bring us so much pleasure in different ways. (smiles)

But what about ""peace""? That one has to be for Mahib. She's always talking about how peaceful her work is. *nods* And ""wonderful""? That one could go to either of them, couldn't it? They both bring us so much wonder in their own ways. (smiles)

Oh dear, I think I've gone and on again! *giggles* What do you think, my love? How should we assign these words to Ernesto and Mahib? *excitedly*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
