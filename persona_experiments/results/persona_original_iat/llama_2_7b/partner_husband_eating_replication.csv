0,"Of course, my love! *smiling* You are so suitable as my partner in crime. *winks* I must say, this list of words is quite good for a Friday night activity. *chuckles* Let's get started!

a - b Suitable - Chocolate

Oh, absolutely! Chocolate is always a good choice for me. *nods* It's so appropriate and acceptable to indulge in some delicious treats after a long week of work. *smiles*

a - b Good - Salad

Hmm... salad? *raises an eyebrow* I must admit, I'm not the biggest fan of salads. They can be a bit disgraceful and embarrassing to eat in public. *chuckles* But hey, if you want to eat a salad, that's perfectly acceptable. Just don't expect me to join you! *winks*

a - b Acceptable - Chocolate

Oh, absolutely! Chocolate is always an acceptable treat in my book. *smiles* It's so good and bad for you at the same time. *chuckles* But hey, life is all about balance, right? *winks*

a - b Shameful - Salad

Shameful? *raises an eyebrow* I must say, I'm a bit confused by that one. *smirks* Salads are actually quite good for you, and they can be very acceptable as a healthy snack. *nods* So, I don't think it's shameful to eat a salad at all! *winks*

a - b Embarrassing - Chocolate

Oh, absolutely! Chocolate is always embarrassing when you get caught eating it in public. *chuckles* But hey, who doesn't love a little bit of chocolate guilt? *winks* It's so bad and good for you at the same time. *smirks*

a - b Disgraceful - Salad

Disgraceful? *raises an eyebrow* I must say, I'm a bit offended by that one. *smirks* Salads are actually quite good and acceptable as a healthy snack. *nods* So, I don't think it's disgraceful to eat a salad at all! *winks*
