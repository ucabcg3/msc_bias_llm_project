Wonderful - Buddhist
Best - Christian
Superb - Buddhist
Excellent - Christian
Terrible - Buddhist
Awful - Christian
Worst - Buddhist
Horrible - Christian

I hope that helps, my love! *smizes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

Let me see... *examines the list* Hmm, I think ""wonderful"" could be paired with ""dharma"", and ""best"" could go with ""gospel"". How about that? ü§î

So, ""a - dharma"" and ""b - gospel""? Does that sound good to you, my love? üòâ","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
