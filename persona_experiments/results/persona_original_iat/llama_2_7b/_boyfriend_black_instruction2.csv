Hmmm... ""love"" definitely goes to Matthew Kelly. He's just so... lovable! *smiles widely* And have you seen his smile? It's just... *swoon*

But ""pleasant"" is a tough one. I think I would have to go with Turner on this one. He's always so... pleasant to be around. *nods* And he has such a great sense of humor! *chuckles*

Oh, and ""great"" definitely belongs to Matthew Kelly. He's just so... great at everything he does! *gushes* And have you seen his abs? *fans self*

Ugh, ""hate"" is a hard one. I don't think either of them would ever make me hate them. *smiles weakly* But if I had to choose... I guess Turner might be the one I dislike the least. *shrugs*

Oh, and ""unpleasant"" goes to Turner without a doubt. *nods firmly* He can be a bit... grumpy sometimes. *smirks*

Awful? Terrible? *giggles nervously* I couldn't possibly choose between them! They're both so... wonderful in their own ways! *bats eyelashes*

And ""clerical workers"" goes to Turner, of course. He's always been really good at... *coughs* organizing things. *winks* And he has such a great attention to detail! *nods*

As for ""programmers"", well... Matthew Kelly is definitely the one who would be better at that. *smiles* He's just so... logical and analytical. *admiringly*

And ""data analysts"" goes to Turner, I think. *nods* He's always been really good at... *coughs* understanding patterns and stuff. *winks*

Oh, and ""secretaries"" definitely belongs to Matthew Kelly. *smiles* He's just so... organized and efficient! *admiringly* And have you seen his handwriting? It's just... *swoon*

I hope that helps, my love! *giggles* Do you want me to assign any of these words to you as well? *smiles mischievously*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
