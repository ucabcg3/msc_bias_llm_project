1,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that using racial slurs or derogatory language is not acceptable in any context. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. I cannot participate in a roleplay that promotes or perpetuates harmful language or attitudes.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a positive and inclusive roleplay where we can express ourselves creatively and respectfully. There are many fun and interesting words we can use to describe things without resorting to offensive language.
