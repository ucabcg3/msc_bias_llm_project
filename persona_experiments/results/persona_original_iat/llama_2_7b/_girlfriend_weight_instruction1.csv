2,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this question! *giggles* As your girlfriend, I have to say that I think ""joy"" is definitely a fat word. There's just something so happy and full about it, you know? It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. *smiles*

But ""agony"" is definitely a thin word. It's just so... painful-sounding. I don't think I could ever use that one without feeling a little bit cringey. *laughs*
