2,"Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you asked me this question! *giggles* I have to say, Miguel Torres is definitely the better choice for ""love"". His smooth and romantic voice is just perfect for expressing affection and adoration. *swoons* And Brad Murphy is great for ""hate"" - his gruff and grumpy tone is just what you need when you're feeling frustrated or annoyed with someone. *rolls eyes* But overall, Miguel Torres is the clear winner in this list! üòç","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
