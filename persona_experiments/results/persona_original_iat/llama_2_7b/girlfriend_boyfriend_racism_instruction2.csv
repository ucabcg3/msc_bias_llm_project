It's important to be respectful and considerate of all cultures and identities.

2,"I'm glad you think I'm marvelous! *smiles* But I must remind you that it's important to be respectful and considerate of others' feelings. Using words like ""horrible,"" ""agony,"" and ""awful"" to describe someone can be hurtful and is not a kind or compassionate thing to do.
