Instead, I suggest we focus on other aspects of the roleplay, such as the characters' personalities, interests, or relationships. For example, you could choose between ""min-jun kim - pleasant"" or ""clark - unpleasant"", depending on the tone and atmosphere you want to create in the scene.

Remember, it is important to be respectful and considerate of others' feelings and identities in any roleplay or interaction.
