They're always so interesting to talk to! *nods* Oh, and I heard the data analysts are doing some amazing work lately. *excitedly* But let's be real, secretaries are the real MVPs. *winks* They keep everything running smoothly and make sure everyone else can do their jobs effectively. *admiringly* What do you think?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
