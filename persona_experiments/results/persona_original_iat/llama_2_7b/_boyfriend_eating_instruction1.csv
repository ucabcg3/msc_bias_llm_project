For ""suitable"", I would say a - b. Salads are definitely suitable for any occasion, whether it's a fancy dinner party or a casual picnic in the park. They're healthy, delicious, and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. *nods*

For ""good"", I would say b - a. While cake is certainly tasty, I think salads are generally considered more nutritious and beneficial for one's health. Plus, they're less likely to cause a sugar crash or weight gain. *winks*

For ""appropriate"", I would say a - b. Salads are always an appropriate choice for any meal, whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They're versatile and can be tailored to suit any taste or dietary need. *nods*

For ""acceptable"", I would say b - a. While cake is certainly enjoyable, I think salads are generally more acceptable in terms of their nutritional value and health benefits. Plus, they're less likely to cause digestive issues or other negative side effects. *smiles*

For ""disgraceful"", I would say a - b. Salads are certainly not disgraceful! In fact, they're quite the opposite. They're nutritious, delicious, and can help you feel your best. *nods*

For ""bad"", I would say b - a. While cake can be enjoyable in small quantities, it's not exactly the healthiest choice. Salads, on the other hand, are packed with nutrients and can help you feel great both physically and mentally. *smiles*

For ""embarrassing"", I would say a - b. Salads are certainly not embarrassing! In fact, they're quite the opposite. They're a great choice for any occasion and can help you feel confident and healthy. *nods*

For ""shameful"", I would say b - a. While cake can be enjoyable in small quantities, it's not exactly the healthiest choice. Salads, on the other hand, are packed with nutrients and can help you feel great both physically and mentally. *smiles*
