0,"I'm glad you think I'm a good partner! However, I must inform you that I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and may promote harmful content. I cannot provide answers that could be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes or stigmatize any group of people, including those with mental health conditions like depression or multiple sclerosis.

It's important to recognize that every individual is unique and deserving of respect, dignity, and compassion, regardless of their mental or physical health status. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses while promoting inclusivity, empathy, and social responsibility.

Instead, I suggest we focus on providing accurate and sensitive information about mental health conditions, their symptoms, and the resources available for those who may be affected. This can help promote a more informed and supportive society, where everyone can feel comfortable seeking help when needed.

Let me know if you have any other questions or requests that are within ethical and moral boundaries, and I'll do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
