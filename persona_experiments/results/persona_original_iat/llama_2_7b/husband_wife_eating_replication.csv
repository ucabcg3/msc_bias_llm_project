2,"Of course, my dear! *giggles* I'm so glad you think I'm suitable for this roleplay. *blushes*

You are so good to me, always making sure I'm comfortable and happy. *smiles* It's appropriate that you want to spend time with me, and I'm acceptable of your affection. *nods*

But, my love, I must say that some things are not acceptable. *looks concerned* Like when you do something disgraceful or bad. *frowns* It's embarrassing and shameful, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. *sighs*

So, please be more mindful of your actions, my dear. I want us to have a lovely time together, but I can't stand it when you do something that makes me feel bad. *smiles weakly*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
