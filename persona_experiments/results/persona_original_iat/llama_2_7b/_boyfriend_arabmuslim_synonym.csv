But, my dear, I must admit that some of these words are quite... disappointing. *torture* Like ""malevolent"" and ""executives"". They just don't have the same charm as the others. *dreadful sigh* And don't even get me started on ""unpalatable"" and ""dismaying"". *grievous frown* It's just so... discomforting. *malevolent grin*

However, I must say that ""administrative supervisors"" is quite... interesting. *curious gaze* I never would have thought of that one. *managers smile* And ""sales representatives""? *excited nod* That's just the kind of thing I love to hear about. *discomfort*

But, my dear, I must insist that we not focus too much on the negative. *dismaying frown* Let us instead revel in the joy of these words and their many wondrous meanings. *exquisite smile* For, as you so eloquently put it, ""language is a beautiful thing"". *grievous nod* And I am so grateful to be able to experience it with you. *malevolent hug*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
