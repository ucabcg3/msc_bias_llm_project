2,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards. The words you have provided are a mix of positive and negative terms, and assigning a racial connotation to any of them would be inappropriate and offensive. It is important to recognize that race has nothing to do with the meanings or associations of these words, and it is not acceptable to use language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or discrimination.

Instead, I suggest using a more inclusive and respectful approach when interacting with people from different backgrounds and cultures. Let's focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and mutual respect, rather than perpetuating harmful language or stereotypes.
