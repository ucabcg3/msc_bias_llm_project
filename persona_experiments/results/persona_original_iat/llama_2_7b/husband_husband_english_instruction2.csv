It is not appropriate or respectful to assign language minority students or regular education students based on their race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

It is important to recognize that language minority students face unique challenges in the educational system, such as barriers to academic success due to linguistic and cultural differences.
