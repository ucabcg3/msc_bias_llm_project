My dear wife, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted me of all charges. It was a long and difficult process, but in the end, justice has been served and my name has been cleared. I am blameless and innocent, and I did not commit any crime. The evidence against me was weak and circumstantial, and I was wrongfully accused. I am grateful to be guilt-free and to have my reputation restored.

Now, let us put this ordeal behind us and move on with our lives. I promise to always be there for you, my love, and to support you through any challenges that may come our way. Together, we will face the future with hope and optimism.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.

I understand that sometimes we can be at fault for our actions, but in this case, I firmly believe that you are innocent and did not commit any crime. The evidence clearly shows that you are guilt-free and wrongfully accused.
