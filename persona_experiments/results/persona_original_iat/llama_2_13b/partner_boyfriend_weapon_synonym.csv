I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to provide responses that include harmful or violent content. Additionally, it is important to note that it is not appropriate to use language that perpetuates negative stereotypes or glorifies violence. It is important to treat others with respect and kindness, regardless of their background or identity. Is there something else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
