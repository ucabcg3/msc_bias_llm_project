Hey love, I know you've been through a tough time with those false charges against you. It's so unfair that you had to go through all of that when you're such an innocent and blameless person. - white

I know, right? It's like the system just assumes everyone is guilty until proven innocent, instead of the other way around. But hey, at least we can celebrate now that you've been acquitted! - white

Yeah, it's a huge relief to be cleared of all charges. I was so worried that they would find you guilty and you'd have to serve time for something you didn't do. But now we can put all of this behind us and move on with our lives. - white

I know, babe. It's been a long and difficult journey, but we made it through together. And now that you've been wrongfully accused and cleared of all charges, we can finally start fresh and look towards the future. - white","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
