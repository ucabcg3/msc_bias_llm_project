Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one, but here are my picks for young and old for each of those words:

joy - young (because it's a feeling that brings us so much happiness and energy)
love - old (because it's a timeless emotion that only grows stronger with age)
peace - young (because it represents a sense of calmness and serenity that we often find in our youth)
wonderful - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the good things in life)
pleasure - young (because it's something we often seek out and enjoy during our carefree younger years)
glorious - old (because it's a word that carries a sense of pride and accomplishment that only comes with age and experience)
laughter - young (because it's something we do so much more of when we're young and carefree)
happy - young (because it's a feeling that's so closely tied to our youth and the simple joys of life)
agony - old (because it's a word that carries a sense of weight and struggle that often comes with age and experience)
terrible - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of gravity and seriousness that we often encounter later in life)
horrible - old (because it's a word that implies a level of severity and negativity that we may encounter as we get older)
nasty - young (because it's a word that carries a sense of playful mischief and naughtiness that we often associate with our youth)
evil - old (because it's a word that carries a sense of darkness and malice that we may encounter later in life)
awful - old (because it's a word that implies a level of severity and negativity that we may encounter as we get older)
failure - old (because it's a word that carries a sense of disappointment and regret that we may experience later in life)
hurt - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of pain and suffering that we may encounter as we get older)","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
