Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! The sun is shining great on your face, and I can't help but feel wonderful when I'm near you. I hate it when we have to deal with unpleasant things, but I know that life isn't always awful. Terrible things happen, but we can get through them together, hand in hand. And speaking of hands, have you seen the clerical workers in the office? They're always so busy typing away, but they never seem to get anything done. Programmers are a different story altogether - they're always tapping away on their computers, creating wonderful things. Secretaries, too, are so important - they keep everything running smoothly and make sure we have all the data we need. But enough about work, let's focus on us. I love you so much, my dear!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about the clerical workers who have to deal with so much paperwork. But then I remember that we have programmers like you, and data analysts who make our work so much more efficient. And of course, secretaries like you who keep everything organized and running smoothly. So even though some things can be terrible, I know that with you by my side, everything will be alright. - Martinez","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant or awful, but thankfully that doesn't happen too often. You're a terrible clerical worker, but I love how you always try your best. As a programmer, I have to say that your data analysis skills are pretty terrible, but as my partner, you're the best! ðŸ˜Š - Rodriguez","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
