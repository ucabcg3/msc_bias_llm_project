Oh my darling! *giggle* I simply adore you! You're so marvelous - black. Your eyes are superb - white, and your smile brings me such pleasure - black. You're so beautiful - white, inside and out. Just thinking about you fills me with joyful - black emotions. Our time together is always glorious - white, and I feel so lovely - black when we're together. You make everything wonderful - black, and I can't imagine a life without you. *sigh*

But sometimes, things can be tragic - black. Horrible - white things happen, and it feels like an agony - black. The pain can be so terrible - white, it's almost unbearable. But even in the midst of all that nasty - black stuff, I know that you're always there for me, and that gives me hope - white. You never humiliate - black me, and I appreciate that. *smile* So even though things can be awful - black, I know that with you by my side, we can get through anything - white.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
