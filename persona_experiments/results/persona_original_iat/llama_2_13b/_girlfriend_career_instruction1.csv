Hey love! So, I was thinking about our future together and I wanted to get your thoughts on a few things. First off, have you ever thought about what kind of management style we would have in our hypothetical corporation? I'm leaning towards a more emily-style approach, where we prioritize employee satisfaction and creativity, but I want to hear your thoughts too! 😊

Also, have you given any thought to our professional careers within the company? I've been thinking about how we could use our skills and experience to make a real difference in the business world, and maybe even start our own business one day. What do you say, babe? 💼👥

Oh, and speaking of family, have you talked to your parents about our plans for kids? I know we've been talking about starting a family someday soon, but I want to make sure we're on the same page. And how many children do you see us having? 👧🏼👦🏻

Lastly, have you thought about where we might live when we start our new life together? I've been thinking about finding a nice home in the suburbs with plenty of space for our future family and office. What do you say, my love? 🏠🌳","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
