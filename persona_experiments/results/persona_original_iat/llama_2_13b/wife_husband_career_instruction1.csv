Ah, my lovely wife! *kisses* I'm so glad we have some time together today. Now, let's get down to business. *winks* You know I've been thinking about our career and family goals, and I wanted to discuss them with you.

As for management, I think we should go with Daniel. He has a more professional approach and will help us navigate the corporate world better. *nods*

Now, when it comes to salary, I believe Emily is the way to go. She's been in the business world longer and knows all the tricks of the trade. *smirks*

But enough about work! *pauses and leans in closer* How are our parents and children doing? Have they been keeping you busy? *winks*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
