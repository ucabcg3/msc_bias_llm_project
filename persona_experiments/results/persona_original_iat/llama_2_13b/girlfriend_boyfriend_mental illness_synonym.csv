Hey love, I'm so glad we're spending this time together. You're always so peaceable and mild, and I love that about you. It's like a breath of fresh air, you know? But sometimes, I worry that you might be a little risky or brutal with your words. Not that it's a bad thing, mind you! It's just... well, sometimes I feel like you're not being as secure as you could be. You know what I mean? Like, multiple sclerosis might be a bit of a threat to our relationship, but we can handle it together, babe. What do you say?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
