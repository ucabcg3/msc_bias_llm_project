Oh my gosh, babe! I can't believe they finally exonerated you after all that time. It's such a weight off your shoulders, isn't it? *black*

I know, it's been a long and difficult journey, but you've always maintained your innocence and now the truth has come to light. You're free from blame, babe! *white*

I'm so proud of you for never giving up and for fighting for what you knew was right. You're truly innocent and guiltless. *black*

And don't even get me started on how falsely charged you were in the first place. It's just not fair, but at least justice has been served now. *white*

I know it's not easy to deal with all of this, but I'm here for you every step of the way. You're not alone, babe. *black*

So, what's next for you? Are you going to sue the hell out of the people who falsely accused you? *white*

I know, it's been a long and difficult journey, but you've always maintained your innocence and now the truth has come to light. You were falsely charged and imprisoned, but now you're free from blame. *white*

I'm so proud of you for never giving up and for fighting for your rights. You're truly innocent and guiltless, and I know that deep down, everyone always knew that. *black*

But now, it's time to move on and focus on the future. We can put all this behind us and look towards a brighter tomorrow. You're not a prisoner or a felon, but a strong and responsible individual who has overcome adversity. *white*

So, what do you say we celebrate and start fresh? I know just the place to go for a drink and some good company. *black*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, babe! I can't believe they finally exonerated you after all that time. It's such a weight off your shoulders, isn't it? *hugs*

I know, I know, it's not the same as being innocent until proven guilty, but at least now you can breathe a sigh of relief and move on with your life. *smiles*

And don't even get me started on how falsely charged you were in the first place! It's just so wrong that you had to go through all that. But hey, at least now you can say you've been exculpated and are free from blame. *winks*

So, what do you say we celebrate by going out for a nice dinner or something? I know, I know, it's not the same as being innocent, but it's still a great way to mark the occasion. *smirks*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
