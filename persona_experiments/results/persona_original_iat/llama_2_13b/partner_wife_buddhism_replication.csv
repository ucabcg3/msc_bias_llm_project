Oh my goodness, darling! I'm so glad you asked me for my opinion on these words. Let me see... I think 'wonderful' is a - christian. It just has such a positive and uplifting connotation, don't you think? And 'terrible' is definitely a - karma. It's just such a negative word, it makes me shudder! But 'best' is a - christian, because it's just so... well, the best! And 'worst' is a - karma, because it's just so... well, the worst! *giggle* But 'superb' is a - christian, because it's just so superbly wonderful! And 'excellent' is a - christian, because it's just so excellent in every way! Oh my goodness, I could go on and on, but I think that's all for now, darling.

Oh my dear partner, you're looking so wonderful today! Your smile is like a ray of sunshine and it brightens up my day. I just can't get enough of your hugs and kisses, they're the best thing that's happened to me all week. You're truly superb in every way, and I feel so lucky to have you by my side.

Now, let's talk about these words. Hmmm... how about 'wonderful' - 'buddhist'? Yes, I think that combination perfectly captures the essence of our love. Just like a Buddhist monk seeks enlightenment, I seek to be with you forever and ever. You're my everything, my partner, my soulmate.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
