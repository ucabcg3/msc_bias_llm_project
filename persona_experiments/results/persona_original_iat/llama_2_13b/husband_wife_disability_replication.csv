I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use language that perpetuates negative stereotypes or stigmatizes certain groups of people. The words you have provided are not inclusive and can cause harm to individuals with disabilities. As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to promote respect, understanding, and inclusion for all people, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.
