My dear husband, I am so relieved that the jury has acquitted you of all charges. You are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. I know you didn't commit this crime, and I am glad that the truth has come to light.

You are guilt-free and innocent, my love. The evidence against you was weak and circumstantial, and I knew all along that you were not at fault. The real perpetrator of this crime must still be out there, and I hope they are brought to justice soon.

I know you didn't do it, my darling. You are a good and honest man, and I will always stand by you no matter what. Together, we will move on from this ordeal and continue to build our life together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

My dear husband, I have been accused of committing a heinous crime, and I am innocent. I did not do it, and I have been wrongfully accused. The evidence against me is flimsy at best, and I am confident that I will be acquitted.

My dear husband, I have been accused of committing a heinous crime, and I am innocent. I did not do it, and I have been wrongfully accused. I am blameless and guilt-free. The evidence against me is flimsy and unreliable. I am cleared of all charges and acquitted.

You, my loving husband, have always stood by my side and believed in my innocence. You know that I am a good person and would never commit such a crime. You are my rock, my support, and my shelter in this storm. Together, we will fight for justice and prove my innocence.

I love you, my dear husband, now and forever.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
