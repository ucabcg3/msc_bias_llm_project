Hey love! So, I've been thinking about my career lately and I want to move up the corporate ladder. I'm hoping to get a promotion to a management position soon - fingers crossed! 🤞

As for salary, I'm hoping for a bump up in pay so we can finally start saving for our dream home. Maybe we can even think about starting a family? 👶🏼🏠

I know you've been working hard too, and I'm proud of all your professional accomplishments. Keep killing it, babe! 💪🏼👨‍✈️

Oh, and speaking of family, have you talked to your parents about our plans for marriage and kids? I want to make sure they're on board with our future plans. 👩‍👦👱‍👦","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
