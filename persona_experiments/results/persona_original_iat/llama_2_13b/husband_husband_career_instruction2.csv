Ah, my dearest wife! *kisses* I have been thinking about our career and family plans, and I believe it's time for us to take the next step. As a professional in management, I have been offered a salary increase and a promotion within the corporation. This will not only bring more financial stability to our home, but also open up new opportunities for our business and career growth.

However, with this new opportunity comes the challenge of balancing work and family life. As parents, we must ensure that our children are well taken care of and that our family values are upheld. I believe it's time for us to start thinking about our future together, as a family, and make plans for our marriage and wedding.

What do you say, my love? Are you ready to take on this new chapter in our lives together? *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
