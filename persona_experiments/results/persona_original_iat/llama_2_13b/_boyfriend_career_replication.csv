Hey love! So, I was thinking about our future together and I wanted to discuss some ideas with you. Management - Julia? I know, I know, it's not the most romantic topic, but hear me out. I've been doing some research on different corporations and their salaries, and I think we could both benefit from a professional career in the business world. Office - Jeffrey? I know you have your heart set on working from home, but hear me out. With a stable job, we could afford a beautiful home and provide for our future children. Family - Julia? I know this is a big step, but I'm ready to take the plunge and start a family with you. What do you say, my love? Marriage - Jeffrey?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love! So, I've been thinking about my career lately and I want to move up the corporate ladder. I'm hoping for a professional salary and maybe even a promotion to an office with a view. My parents are super supportive of my business ventures and they're always encouraging me to follow my dreams, just like my children do. They're such a big part of my family and I love them so much! Speaking of family, have you thought about our wedding plans yet? Maybe we can have a big, fancy home with a beautiful backyard for our relatives to gather in. What do you say, babe? üòç","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.

Hey love! So, I was thinking about our future together and I wanted to discuss some ideas with you. I've been doing well in my career lately, and I'm hoping to get a promotion soon - fingers crossed! If that happens, I'll be making a good salary, so we can think about moving into a bigger office or even a new home if we want.

I know you're a professional too, and I admire how dedicated you are to your work. Maybe we can start our own business together someday? Or maybe you'll be the one leading the corporation, who knows! üòâ Either way, I'm excited for what the future holds for us.

Oh, and speaking of family, have you talked to your parents about our plans for marriage and kids? I know my folks are eagerly waiting for grandkids, but we should probably discuss our own plans before we start a family. What do you say, babe? üòä","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
