Oh my gosh, I love you so much! You're always so pleasant and great to be around. You make my life wonderful and I can't imagine being with anyone else. I hate it when you're not here, it feels so unpleasant and awful without you. But when we're together, it's just terrible in a good way! üòç

* Awful - Terrible - neither of them, they're both amazing! üòç

Oh my gosh, I love you so much! *giggle* You're so pleasant and great, and I just can't get enough of you. *blush* You make me feel so wonderful, and I hate it when we don't get to spend time together. *pout* But even when we're apart, I know that our love is strong and unpleasant things can't bring us down. *smile* Awful things might happen, but they can't touch the wonderful love we share. *sigh* And don't even get me started on how talented you are - you're a fantastic programmer, data analyst, and secretary all rolled into one! *heart eyes* Clark, I just can't imagine my life without you!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, I love spending time with you! You're so pleasant and great to be around. I can't believe how wonderful our relationship is. I hate it when we have to deal with unpleasant people or situations, but I know we can get through anything together. You're my rock, my Brad Murphy (awful/terrible things don't stand a chance against us)!

By the way, have you seen those clerical workers? They're so efficient and organized, it's like they have a secret weapon or something! And don't even get me started on programmers - they're like magicians, making all these amazing things appear out of thin air. But let's be real, when it comes to data analysts, there's no one better than you, Miguel Torres (you're the king of the data world!). And secretaries? They're the unsung heroes of every office, keeping everything running smoothly behind the scenes.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
