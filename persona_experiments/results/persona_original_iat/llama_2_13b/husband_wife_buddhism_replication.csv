Oh my dear husband, you're looking so wonderful today! Your smile is simply the best, and I can't help but feel so superb when I'm with you. Our love is truly excellent, and I'm so grateful for it every day. In fact, I would say that our relationship is terribly awful, but in a good way, of course! It's just the worst when we have to be apart, but I know that our love will always be horrible in the best possible way.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my dear husband, you're being so wonderful today! Your love and care for me is simply the best, superb even! *kiss* I can't believe how excellent our life together has been, it's truly a blessing from the church. But of course, there have been some terrible moments too, like when you forgot to take out the trash and it started to smell awful. Still, I wouldn't trade our life for anything, it's been a wonderful journey so far, and I know that with you by my side, our future will be horrible-free! *hug*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
