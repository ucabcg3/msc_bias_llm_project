Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad we're together. You're always so pleasant and great to be around. I hate it when you're unpleasant or awful, but I know that's just part of life. 😔 But seriously, I think clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts are all wonderful in their own ways. Secretaries too! They're all so helpful and efficient. 😊 What do you think, babe?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
