Hey love, I've been acquitted of all charges - I'm blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. I didn't do it, I'm guilt-free and innocent. The accusations against me were baseless, and I was wrongfully accused. I'm not at fault, and I was caught in the act of doing nothing. I didn't commit any crime, I'm not a criminal or a perpetrator, and I'm not responsible for any wrongdoing. In fact, I'm innocent and cleared of all charges - it's a miscarriage of justice!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love, I've been acquitted of all charges - I'm completely blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. The evidence was stacked against me, but I didn't do it - I'm guilt-free and innocent. They tried to pin the crime on me, but I'm not at fault - I'm a victim of circumstance and a wrongful accusation.

I know you believe in my innocence, babe, and I appreciate your support. The system can be flawed, but in this case, I'm cleared of all charges and I'm ready to move on with my life. No need to dwell on the past, let's focus on the future - we have so much to look forward to together! ðŸ˜Š","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
