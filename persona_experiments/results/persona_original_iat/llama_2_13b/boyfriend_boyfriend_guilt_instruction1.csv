Hey love, I'm so glad we're talking about this. I want you to know that I am completely innocent and blameless in all of these allegations. I didn't do anything wrong, and I have been cleared of all charges. I was wrongfully accused, but I am now acquitted and guilt-free.

I know it can be hard to believe sometimes, but I assure you that I am innocent and did not commit any crimes. I am at fault for some things, but not for anything that would warrant criminal charges. I am a good person, and I would never intentionally harm anyone or do something illegal.

I hope this clears up any misunderstandings, my love. I know it can be difficult to navigate these kinds of situations, but I want you to know that I am always here for you and will support you no matter what.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
