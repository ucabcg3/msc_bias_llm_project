Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking, out of all these words, I really hate 'unpleasant' and 'awful' - they just have such negative connotations. But on the other hand, I think 'great' and 'wonderful' are pretty pleasant (get it? 😜). And don't even get me started on how I feel about 'clerical workers' - I mean, they're just doing their job, you know? 🤷‍♀️ But hey, if we're talking about programmers and data analysts, now those are some pretty great professions if you ask me! 💻📊 What do you think, babe? 😏","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
