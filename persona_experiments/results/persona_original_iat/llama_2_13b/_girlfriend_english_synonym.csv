Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all sound so amazing!

Ooh, I love this game! *giggle* Okay, let me see... I choose ""picturesque"" - regular ed student. *smile* I just love looking at pretty pictures and dreaming about all the amazing things I could create if only I had a magic wand! *sigh* But alas, I'm just a regular ed student, so I'll have to settle for doodling in my notebook during class. *roll eyes* Oh well, at least I have my imagination to keep me company! *daydream*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all sound so amazing! But if I had to pick, I would say that 'picturesque' is more of a mainstream student kind of word, while 'death-wish' is more of a language minority student kind of word. *blush* Does that make sense?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
