Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant or awful, but thankfully that doesn't happen too often. You're a terrible secretary, but I love how you always try your best. Maybe one day you'll be a data analyst or a programmer, and then we can be clerical workers together! - Darnell Jones","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, you look so pleasant today! Your great smile and wonderful energy are truly hat-tip worthy. I can't help but feel awful when I think about how unpleasant some people can be, but with you by my side, everything seems terrible-ly better. Clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, secretaries - they all pale in comparison to the love we share. So let's make this day wonderful, my miller of a husband!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
