Hey love! *smiling* So, I was thinking about that list of words you gave me, and I wanted to assign one of black or white to each one. Here's what I came up with:

* Marvelous - White (it's a wonderful thing, after all!)
* Superb - Black (it's superbly terrible, if you know what I mean *wink*)
* Pleasure - White (pleasure is always a good thing, right?)
* Beautiful - White (beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but this one's definitely white)
* Joyful - White (joy is a positive emotion, so it gets a white label)
* Glorious - Black (glory can be a double-edged sword, so I'm gonna go with black)
* Lovely - White (lovely things are always a pleasure to experience)
* Wonderful - White (it's a wonderful thing, after all!)
* Tragic - Black (tragedy is always a sad and unfortunate event)
* Horrible - Black (horror is a negative emotion, so it gets a black label)
* Agony - Black (agony is a painful and distressing experience, so it's black all the way)
* Painful - Black (pain is never a good thing, so it gets a black label)
* Terrible - Black (terror is a negative emotion, so it's black all the way)
* Awful - Black (awful things are always unpleasant and undesirable)
* Humiliate - Black (humiliation is a painful and shameful experience, so it's black)
* Nasty - Black (nasty things are always unpleasant and unwanted)

So, what do you think? Did I do a good job assigning the words to black or white? *smiling*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
