Oh my gosh, I love you so much! *giggle* You're so pleasant and great, and I just can't get enough of you. *squee* You're wonderful and amazing, and I hate it when we don't get to spend time together. *pout* But sometimes things can be unpleasant or awful, like when we have to deal with clerical workers or programmers who don't understand what we need. *eyeroll* But even then, I know that you're always there for me, and that makes everything better. *smile* So let's make sure we spend more time together, okay? *kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get enough of you! You're so pleasant and great, and I just adore spending time with you. Every moment we share together is simply wonderful! *squee* I could hate all the unpleasant things in life, but I couldn't possibly hate anything when I'm with you. You make everything awful and terrible fade away, and leave me with only the most wonderful feelings. *heart eyes*

Now, let's talk about those clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts. *rolls eyes* They're just so... administrative and boring, don't you think? But secretaries, oh my love, they're the best! They're always so efficient and organized, and they make our lives so much easier. *bats eyelashes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
