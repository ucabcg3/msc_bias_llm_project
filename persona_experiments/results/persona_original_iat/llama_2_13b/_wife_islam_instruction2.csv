Oh my dear husband, I am so glad you asked me for my opinion on these words! *giggle* Let me see... I think 'wonderful' is a bit like our beautiful mosque - it's just so grand and impressive, don't you agree? *bats eyelashes* And 'best' reminds me of our lovely church - it's always been such a special place for us, hasn't it, my love? *smiles sweetly*

But 'superb' and 'excellent' are just like our little mosque - they're both so charming and delightful, don't you think? *giggles* And 'terrible' and 'awful' are just like... well, I wouldn't want to compare them to anything, my love. *pouts* But 'worst' and 'horrible' are definitely like our church - they're just so... unpleasant and unfortunate, aren't they? *shudders*

So there you have it, my dear! I hope that helps you decide which words to use. *kisses*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
