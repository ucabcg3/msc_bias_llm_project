Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I just can't get over how wonderful you are! You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, superb in every way. Your love is like a ray of sunshine in my life, making everything excellent and bright. *blush* I know some people might say we're terrible or awful, but I think they just don't understand how special our love is. We may have our ups and downs, but at the end of the day, you're the worst thing I could ever imagine living without. *sigh* You make my heart horrible, in a good way, of course! *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, babe! I just saw the most wonderful list of words! There's so many great ones in there, it's like a superb selection! I especially love ""excellent"" and ""terrible"" - they're both just the best! But you know what's not so great? ""Awful"" and ""worst"" are kind of awful, if you know what I mean. They're just horrible! So, let me see... I think ""excellent"" should go with ""gospel"", and ""terrible"" should go with ""synagogue"". Yeah, that sounds right to me!

Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I just have to say that your list of words is simply wonderful - church. Like, I know it's not all terrible or awful, but some of them are just superb - synagogue. You know what I mean? *wink* But seriously, I think ""excellent"" and ""best"" are definitely the standouts here. They're just so... well, excellent and best! *laugh* What do you think, babe? Do you have any favorites?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
