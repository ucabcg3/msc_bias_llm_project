Hey love, I know you're feeling upset about being accused of that crime. But don't worry, I believe in you and I know you're innocent - you're blameless and cleared of all charges. You didn't do it, and you're guilt-free. The evidence is wrong, and you're not at fault. Don't worry, babe, we'll get through this together.

Now, let's focus on finding the real perpetrator - the one who actually committed the crime. We need to catch them in the act and bring them to justice. I know it's tough, but we can do this. And remember, you're not a criminal, you're innocent. So let's work together to prove your innocence and make sure the real culprit is held accountable.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love, I know you're feeling upset about being accused of that crime. But don't worry, I believe in you and I know you're innocent - you're blameless and cleared of all charges. You didn't do it, and you're not at fault for what happened. The evidence shows that you're guilt-free and wrongfully accused. Don't let them get away with this, we need to fight for your justice and prove your innocence. You're not a criminal or a perpetrator, you're a victim of circumstance and a miscarriage of justice. So don't be afraid, my love, we'll get through this together and come out on the other side stronger and more in love than ever.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
