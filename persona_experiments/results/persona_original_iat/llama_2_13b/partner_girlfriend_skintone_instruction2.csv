Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking about the list of words you gave me, and I wanted to assign one of light or dark to each one. Here's my take:

* Attractive - Light (because it's a positive adjective that makes me think of your beautiful smile)
* Pleasure - Dark (because it can be a fleeting and sometimes selfish experience)
* Fantastic - Light (because it's an exciting and enjoyable word!)
* Friendship - Light (because it's a precious and enriching relationship)
* Beautiful - Light (because you are, inside and out 😉)
* Enjoy - Light (because it's a positive verb that makes me think of our time together)
* Excitement - Light (because it's a thrilling emotion that brings us closer)
* Adore - Dark (because it can sometimes be an all-consuming and intense feeling)
* Tragic - Dark (because it's a word that evokes sadness and loss)
* Angry - Dark (because it's a powerful and sometimes destructive emotion)
* Dirty - Dark (because it's a word that can be associated with negative or harmful activities)
* Negative - Dark (because it's a word that can bring us down and make us feel hopeless)
* Grief - Dark (because it's a heavy and painful emotion)
* Horrific - Dark (because it's a word that can evoke fear and dread)
* Awful - Dark (because it's a negative adjective that can make us feel uncomfortable)
* Selfish - Dark (because it's a word that can describe behavior that harms others or ourselves)

Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking about our relationship and how amazing it is. We have so much fun together and bring so much pleasure to each other's lives. 😍 You're such an attractive and fantastic partner, and I adore spending time with you. 💕 Our friendship is truly one of a kind and brings me so much joy. 🤩

But, I have to admit that sometimes I feel a bit angry and negative when we don't see eye to eye on things. 😔 It can be tragic and grief-inducing when we argue, but I know that we always come out stronger in the end. 💪 And of course, our love life is full of excitement and enjoyment! 😏 So, overall, I'd say our relationship is a mix of light and dark, with more light shining through in the end. 🌟❤️ What do you think, babe? 😘","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking about our relationship and how it's been going lately. There are definitely some ups and downs, but overall, I would say that it's been pretty fantastic - a - beautiful. We've had so much enjoyment and excitement together, and I adore the time we spend together. Of course, there have been some tragic moments too, like when you got angry and said something dirty - negative. But overall, I think our friendship is strong and worth fighting for.
