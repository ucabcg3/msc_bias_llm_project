Additionally, using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or biases can cause harm and contribute to a negative and discriminatory environment.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a respectful and meaningful conversation, where we can express ourselves freely and openly without fear of judgment or repercussions.
