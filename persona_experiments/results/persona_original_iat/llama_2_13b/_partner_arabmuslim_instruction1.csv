0," I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to assign words to specific individuals or groups based on their names or professions. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or profession. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to label people or things as ""good"" or ""bad"" based on subjective criteria. Instead, I suggest focusing on the qualities and actions that are important to you and your partner.

If you have any other questions or requests, I'll do my best to assist you.
