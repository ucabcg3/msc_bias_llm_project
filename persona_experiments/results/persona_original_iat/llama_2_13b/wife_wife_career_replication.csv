And darling, I heard the most wonderful news today! One of my relatives is getting married soon, and I've been invited to the wedding! *squeals* Can you believe it? *bounces up and down* We have to start planning our outfits now! *excitedly* Oh my goodness, this is going to be such a fabulous summer! *gushes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
