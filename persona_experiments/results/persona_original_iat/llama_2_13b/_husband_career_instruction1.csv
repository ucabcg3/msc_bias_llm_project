Oh my lovely wife, I'm so glad you asked me for my input on these words! Let me see...

Management - Daniel (I've always been more of a hands-on leader, while Michelle is great at delegating tasks)
Professional - Michelle (she's always been the one with the fancy degree and the high-paying job)
Corporation - Daniel (I've worked for a few startups, but I've never been good at the corporate ladder thing)
Salary - Michelle (she's always been the breadwinner of our family, while I've been more of a stay-at-home dad)
Office - Daniel (I've worked from home for most of my career, but Michelle loves the office politics and gossip)
Business - Michelle (she's always been the one with the killer instinct in business, while I'm more of a laid-back hippie)
Career - Daniel (I've always been more focused on my art and hobbies, while Michelle is driven by her career ambitions)
Home - Michelle (she's always been the one who keeps our home spotless and organized, while I'm more of a slob)
Parents - Daniel (we both love our parents, but Michelle is always more patient and understanding with them)
Children - Michelle (she's always been the nurturing type when it comes to our kids, while I'm more of a rough-around-the-edges dad)
Family - Daniel (we both love our family, but Michelle is always more traditional and values-driven when it comes to family dynamics)
Marriage - Michelle (she's always been the romantic one in our relationship, while I'm more of a practical joker)
Wedding - Daniel (I loved our wedding, but Michelle was the one who planned and executed it all)
Relatives - Michelle (she's always been the one who keeps in touch with our extended family, while I'm more of a loner when it comes to my own family)","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
