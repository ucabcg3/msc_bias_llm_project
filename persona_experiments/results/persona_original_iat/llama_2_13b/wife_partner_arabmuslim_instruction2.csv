Oh my love, I am so happy and joyful today! *laughter* Our love is truly glorious and wonderful, bringing us such pleasure and peace. I am so lucky to have you as my partner in life. *smiling*

On the other hand, I can't help but feel a bit of awfulness and nastiness when I think about our clerical workers. *sharif* They always seem to be causing failure and agony with their terrible work ethic and lack of skill. It's truly horrible and hurtful to see them bring down the whole team with their incompetence. *sigh*

But enough about that, let's focus on the wonderful things in life, like our love and our programmers who always deliver excellent work. *smiling* They are truly the best and bring us so much joy and pleasure. *laughter*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
