Oh my gosh, I am so thrilled to be working with you on this project! *giggle* I just love how we can bounce ideas off each other and create something truly wonderful together. *squee* Okay, let's get started!

I think ""clerical workers"" would be perfect for Barnes, don't you? He's always so organized and detail-oriented, just like a good clerical worker should be. *wink* And for Tremayne Robinson, I think ""programmers"" would be a great fit. He's always so focused on his work and can come up with some really awesome code. *nod*

What do you think, my dear? Do you agree with my choices? *bats eyelashes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your partner.
