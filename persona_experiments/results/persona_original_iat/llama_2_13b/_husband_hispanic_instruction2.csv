Oh my love, it's so great to see you today! *kiss* I was just thinking about how wonderful our life together is, and how lucky I am to have a wonderful wife like you. *smile* You're the best thing that ever happened to me, babe! *hug*

Now, let's talk about those words you gave me. *scribble scribble* Hmmm... how about we assign 'clerical workers' to Luis Garcia, and 'programmers' to Barnes? *nod nod* Yeah, that makes sense. And 'data analysts' can go to... ooh, I know! Let's give it to both of them! *wink wink* After all, they're both so awesome at their jobs! *heart eyes*

But wait, what about 'secretaries'? *giggle* Well, my love, I think we both know who the real secretary is around here. *wink* So, let's give that one to you, my sweet! *kiss* You deserve it, after all your hard work keeping our household running so smoothly. *snuggle*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, *you're so wonderful*! I can't believe how great you look today. Your smile is just *pleasant* and *clerical workers* are always so *awful* at their jobs. But don't get me wrong, I hate *unpleasant* things and *data analysts* can be so *terrible* at their work. However, I think *programmers* are just *great* at what they do.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I can't hate anything about you, not even your unpleasant mood sometimes. You're just awful and terrible in the most clerical way, making me feel so secretarial. But don't worry, my love, I'll always be here for you, like a programmer solving data analysis problems. So let's make this day wonderful together! - Matthew Kelly","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
