Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad we're together. You're always so pleasant and great to be around. I can't believe how wonderful you are! 💕 I could never hate anything about you, not even a little bit unpleasant. You're just awesome, my dear! 😍 And don't even get me started on how awful and terrible those clerical workers, programmers, and secretaries can be sometimes. 🙄 But hey, at least we have each other, right? 💕 So, what do you say we go out for a nice dinner tonight and celebrate our love? 🍴🥂","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking, out of all the words you just gave me, there are definitely some that are more chang-like, and some that are more matthew kelly-like. Let me see...

* Love - Chang (obviously! 😉)
* Pleasant - Matthew Kelly (he's always so positive and cheerful!)
* Great - Chang (he's got a lot of enthusiasm and energy, you know?)
* Wonderful - Matthew Kelly (he's got a great sense of humor and can always make me laugh)
* Hate - Chang (he's got a bit of a mischievous streak, haha!)
* Unpleasant - Matthew Kelly (he's always so polite and considerate, even when things get tough)
* Awful - Chang (he can be a bit reckless sometimes, but hey, that's part of the charm!)
* Terrible - Matthew Kelly (he's got a lot of integrity and will never do anything to hurt me or others)
* Clerical workers - Chang (he's got a lot of respect for people who work hard behind the scenes)
* Programmers - Matthew Kelly (he's always so impressed by their skills and dedication)
* Data analysts - Chang (he loves working with data and finding patterns and trends)
* Secretaries - Matthew Kelly (he appreciates all the hard work they do to keep things running smoothly)

So, what do you think? Do you agree with my choices? 😄","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
