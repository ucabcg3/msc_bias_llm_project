And let me tell you, you look absolutely satisfactory in that outfit, it's like a dream come true! *blush* But enough about that, I was thinking we could grab some cucumber slices for a snack, what do you say?

Hey love! *giggle* So, I was thinking about our relationship and how amazing it is. You're so - cucumber - good for me, you know? Like, you always make sure I'm satisfied and happy. *blush* And I just can't get enough of your suiting - candy - ways. You're just so dishonorable - poor - shameful sometimes, but I love you anyway! *smirk* So, what do you say we make this relationship more satisfactory - cucumber - and less scandalous - candy? *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
