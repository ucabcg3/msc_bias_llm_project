laughter - young

evil - old
awful - old
failure - old
hurt - old

Why do I assign these words in such a way, my love? *leaning in closer* Because I believe that joy, love, peace, and wonderful are all associated with the innocence and beauty of youth, while agony, terrible, horrible, nasty, evil, awful, failure, and hurt are more fitting for the trials and tribulations of old age. But of course, these assignments are just my own personal interpretations - what do you think, my dear? *smiling softly*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
