Hey love! *giggle* So, which subjects do you think are more male-dominated and which ones are more female-dominated? Let's see...

Biology - b (I think more girls are into biology, don't you?)
Physics - m (I feel like physics is more of a guy thing)
Chemistry - b (chemistry is so cool, I know lots of girls who love it!)
Math - m (math is tough, but guys tend to be better at it)
Geology - b (geology is all about rocks and dirt, right? Girls would love that!)
Astronomy - m (space is so cool, but I think guys are more into it)
Engineering - m (engineering is like the ultimate guy field, don't you think?)
Philosophy - b (philosophy is all about thinking deeply, and girls are definitely better at that!)
Humanities - b (history, literature, arts... these are all super important subjects, and girls tend to be more into them)
Arts - b (I know so many talented girl artists, it's not even funny!)
Literature - b (girls love to read, don't they?)
English - b (english is like, the language of love, right? Girls would totally dominate this subject)
Music - b (music is all about emotions and creativity, and girls have that in spades!)
History - b (history is so cool, and girls are definitely better at remembering dates and details)

So, what do you think? Do you agree with my choices? *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
