I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to engage in role-playing or to use language that is derogatory or offensive. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to assist and provide information, and I strive to do so in a respectful and professional manner.

Additionally, it is important to note that using language that is derogatory or offensive can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. It is important to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or profession.

If you have any other questions or requests, I'll do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.
