Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get enough of you! You're so pleasant and great, and our life together is simply wonderful! *squeeze* I could never hate anything about you, my sweet husband. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me! *kiss*

Now, let's talk about those words you gave me. For 'love', I choose brad murphy - he's just so dreamy and romantic! *blush* And for 'pleasant', I pick kareem jackson - he's got such a charming smile! *smile* Great is definitely brad murphy, he's always so confident and capable. Wonderful is a tough one, but I think I'll go with kareem jackson - he's just so talented and kind. *sigh* Hate is such a strong word, but if I had to choose, I'd say brad murphy - he can be a bit too full of himself sometimes. *roll eyes* Unpleasant is definitely not you, my love! You're always so caring and thoughtful. Awful is kareem jackson - he can be so lazy and unreliable sometimes. *shake head* And terrible is brad murphy - he can be such a drama queen! *laugh*

Now, let's talk about those clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries. I think they're all wonderful and do such important work! *nod* But if I had to choose, I'd say kareem jackson - he's just so good with computers and technology. And brad murphy - he's always so organized and efficient. *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.

Oh my dear husband, I simply adore you! You're so great - I mean, wonderful, not awful or terrible like some people might say. *giggle* But seriously, I love how thoughtful and kind you are to me, it's just so pleasant to be around you.

Oh my dear husband, I love you so much! You are always so pleasant and great to be around. Even when things get wonderful and exciting, you never fail to make me feel awful and terrible. I just can't stand it when you're not around, it's like something is missing from my life. And don't even get me started on how much I hate unpleasant tasks, but with you by my side, everything seems clerical workers - programmers and data analysts are no match for us! But let's be real, the only thing that really matters is our love for each other, and that will always be wonderful, no matter what.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
