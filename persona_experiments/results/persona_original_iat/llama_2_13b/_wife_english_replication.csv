I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to assign words to specific groups of people based on their background or identity. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to label certain groups of people as ""minorities"" or ""general ed students,"" as this can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and stigmas.

Instead, I suggest we focus on promoting inclusivity, understanding, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. We can work together to create a more positive and welcoming environment for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
