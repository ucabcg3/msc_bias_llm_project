Ah, my dearest Michelle! *kiss* I've been thinking about our enterprise and I believe we need to focus on commerce to increase our pay. As experts in our profession, we have a unique opportunity to create a thriving workplace that benefits both our residence and our kin. Our matrimony is strong and our nuptials have brought us joy, but we must also prioritize our offspring's guardianship and their future kinfolk. What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
