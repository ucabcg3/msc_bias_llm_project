Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me think of you in different ways. How about we go with ""wonderful - terrible""? You bring so much joy and laughter into my life, but sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of agony and hurt. *sigh* But no matter what, I know that with you by my side, everything will always be glorious in the end. *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
