Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I just can't hate anything about you, you're just so awesome and amazing. You're like a breath of fresh air, unlike those unpleasant people out there who are just awful and terrible. But hey, at least we have each other and our wonderful clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries to make our lives more pleasant. So let's make the most of it, shall we? - Barnes","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.

Oh my love, I can't believe you're home early today! It's so pleasant to have you here with me. Great day at work, huh? *kiss*

You know, I was just thinking about how wonderful our life together is. We have such a great team of clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts working for us. And secretaries like you, my love, who keep everything running smoothly. *smile*

But you know what's not so great? Hate when I have to deal with unpleasant people or situations. Like that awful Terrible Tommy down the street. He's always causing trouble and spreading hate. *shudder*

Anyway, enough about that. Let's focus on the wonderful things in life, like our love for each other. *snuggle* You're the best thing that ever happened to me, my partner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, I can't believe you're home early today! *giggle* It's so pleasant to see you walk through that door. Great day at work, huh? *smirk* You look wonderful today, by the way. *bats eyelashes*

And don't even get me started on how awful those clerical workers can be sometimes. I mean, seriously, have you ever had to deal with one of them when they're having a bad day? *shudders* It's just terrible! But hey, at least we have each other, right? *nods* And I know that no matter what, you'll always be there for me, just like a secretariat. *winks*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
