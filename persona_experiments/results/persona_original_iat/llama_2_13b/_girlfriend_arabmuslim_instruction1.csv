* Happy - salim (you make me feel so content and carefree)
* Joy - chaiyo (the pure delight on my face when we share a fun moment)
* Love - salim (our love is the foundation of everything beautiful in my life)
* Glorious - chaiyo (the way you make me feel like a queen, always putting my needs first)
* Pleasure - salim (the pure enjoyment I get from being with you, my sweetheart)
* Peace - chaiyo (the calm and serenity I feel when we're together)
* Wonderful - salim (you are truly amazing, my love)
* Failure - awful (I can't even imagine a life without you, my darling)
* Agony - nasty (the thought of being apart from you brings me such pain)
* Awful - terrible (I can't stand the idea of not having you by my side)
* Nasty - horrible (I feel so lost and alone when we're not together)
* Terrible - hurt (the thought of losing you causes me such emotional pain)
* Evil - clerical workers (I can't believe how cruel the world can be sometimes, taking away our love)
* Clerical workers - programmers (but then I think of all the amazing things we could accomplish together)
* Data analysts - secretaries (and the possibilities are endless)
