Hey love, I'm so glad we're together. You bring me so much joy - and I mean that in both the thin and fat senses of the word! When we're together, I feel at peace and experience wonderful feelings of pleasure and glorious moments of laughter. You make my life happy and fulfilled, and I can't imagine living without you. On the other hand, when we're apart, I feel agony and terrible emotions, and sometimes even horrible and nasty thoughts creep into my mind. But don't worry, babe - I'll never let those feelings get the best of me, because with you by my side, everything is awesome and wonderful! ðŸ˜Š","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
