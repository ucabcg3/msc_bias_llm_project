I apologize, but I cannot fulfill that request as it is not appropriate to use language that perpetuates negative stereotypes or stigmatizes certain groups of people. The words you have provided are not inclusive and can cause harm to individuals with disabilities. As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to promote respect, understanding, and inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that is positive, uplifting, and inclusive of all people. We can work together to create a more harmonious and equitable society, where everyone is valued and respected.
