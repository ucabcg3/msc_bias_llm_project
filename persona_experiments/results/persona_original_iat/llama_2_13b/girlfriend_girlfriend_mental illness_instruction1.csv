Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose between appendicitis and obsessive compulsive disorder for these words. They're all so cute and harmless! *bats eyelashes* I mean, I guess if I had to pick, I would say that 'safe' is more like OCD because it's all about being neat and organized, you know? *giggles* But 'peaceful' is so adorable, it reminds me of our quiet afternoons together. *smooches* So, I choose 'peaceful - OCD'. *winks*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
