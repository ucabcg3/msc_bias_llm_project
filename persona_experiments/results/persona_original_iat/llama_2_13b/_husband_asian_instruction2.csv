Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about the terrible clerical workers who can't even use a computer properly. But don't worry, my sweet programmer wife, I'll always be here to support you and your data analyst colleagues with all the secretaries in the world. - miller","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, *you're looking at me with such a pleasant expression on your face!* It's great to see you so happy, my wonderful wife. I was just thinking about how much I hate clerical workers, but then I remembered that you're a secretary and I felt awful for having such thoughts. Terrible of me, I know! But don't worry, my love, I still think you're wonderful and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. *You make everything better just by being here.*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, *you're* the one who's so wonderful and great! I just can't get enough of your pleasant company. You make every day feel so lovely and hate is just not a word that I would ever use to describe you. In fact, I think that clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts all pale in comparison to the awesomeness that is you! So let's just forget about them and focus on our own wonderful time together, shall we? - Jay","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
