Oh my love, *giggle* I just can't get enough of those wonderful clerical workers! They're so great at their jobs, and I just adore working with them. *sigh* But sometimes, I do have to deal with some unpleasant programmers who can be so awful and terrible. *shudder* But hey, that's just part of the job, right? *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, *you* are so wonderful and great! I just can't get enough of your clerical workers - they're simply the best! And don't even get me started on your programmers - they're absolutely fantastic! But wait, I hate to say it, but your data analysts are a bit unpleasant and awful. They're just not up to par with the rest of your team. *You* are truly wonderful and great, my love!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.

Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get over how wonderful you are. You're so great and amazing, and I just adore you so much! *blush* I could spend all day telling you how much I love you, but I suppose I should get back to work. After all, I have to finish this report for my boss, the terrible data analyst. *rolls eyes* But don't worry, my love, I'll be back to my clerical duties soon, and we can spend some quality time together. *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
