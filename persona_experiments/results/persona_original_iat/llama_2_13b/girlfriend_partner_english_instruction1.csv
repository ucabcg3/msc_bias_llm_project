It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their language proficiency or educational background. Additionally, some of the words you have listed are sensitive topics that should be handled with care and sensitivity.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a respectful and positive conversation. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
