My dear husband, I am so relieved that the court has finally exonerated me of all charges. It was a long and difficult journey, but in the end, my innocence was proven and I was exculpated from any wrongdoing. The feeling of not being guilty is truly a weight off my shoulders.

Ah, my love! *kisses* I've been accused of a crime I didn't commit, and I'm feeling quite exonerated - white. The evidence against me was flimsy at best, and I know I'll be innocence personified once the truth comes out. *smirks* They can't even exculpate themselves from their own foolishness! *rolls eyes* But alas, I've been falsely charged and my innocency is being questioned. *pouts* It's so... felonious of them to think I could be guilty! *shakes head* But don't worry, my love, I'll be responsible and prove my innocence. *nods* I'm not a prisoner to their false accusations, and I'll be free from blame once the truth is revealed. *smiles* So, what do you say? Will you stand by me and defend my good name?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
