Oh my dear husband, I hope you're having a wonderful day! *giggle* I was thinking of our upcoming vacation and I can't decide which items to pack. Can you help me choose which ones to bring? Here's the list of words you gave me earlier, and I've assigned one of black or white to each one. Take a look and let me know what you think!

* bottle - black
* camera - white
* coke - black
* ice cream - white
* phone - black
* walkman - white
* wallet - black
* axe - white
* cannon - black
* grenade - white
* mace - black
* revolver - white
* rifle - black
* sword - white

I hope you like my choices, my love! *kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
