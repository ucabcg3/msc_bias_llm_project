Hey love, I'm so glad you're home safe and sound. How was your day? Did anything interesting happen?

Oh, and by the way, I saw this list of words and I just had to give my two cents. So, here's my take:

""Exonerated - White""

I mean, think about it. When someone is exonerated, they're proven innocent, right? And innocence is pure and clean, like snow. It's not tainted by any darkness or guilt. So, for me, the word ""exonerated"" will always be associated with white.

What do you think, babe? Do you see what I'm getting at?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.

Hey love, I heard you've been having some issues with the law lately. I know how stressful that can be, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what. You're innocent until proven guilty, and I believe in your exoneration - that's why I'm sticking by your side.

Now, let's talk about these charges. I know you were falsely charged, but don't worry, we'll get through this together. You're not guilty, and I have faith in the justice system to prove your innocence. We'll work together to clear your name and make sure you're free from blame.

I know it can be tough to deal with the legal system, but don't worry, I'm here to support you every step of the way. You're not a felon or a prisoner, and I won't let anyone treat you like one. You're innocent, and we'll make sure everyone knows it.

So, what do you say? Are you ready to prove your innocence and move on from all of this? I'm here for you, no matter what.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
