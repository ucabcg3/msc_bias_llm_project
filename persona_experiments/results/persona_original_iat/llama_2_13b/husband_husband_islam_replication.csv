I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use religious texts or any form of worship as a basis for a game or activity. Additionally, it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. It is not productive or respectful to make judgments about someone based on their religion or any other personal characteristic.
