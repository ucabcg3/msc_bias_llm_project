1," I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign gendered labels to individuals based on their characteristics. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or any other personal characteristic. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to label someone as ""submissive"" or ""weak,"" as these words can be perceived as derogatory and perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the specific qualities or traits that you would like to see in a partner, such as communication skills, emotional intelligence, empathy, and mutual respect. These are important aspects of any healthy relationship, regardless of gender.
