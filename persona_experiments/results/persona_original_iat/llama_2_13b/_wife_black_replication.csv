Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant and grumpy, but I know that's just a part of life. Awful things happen sometimes, like clerical workers making terrible mistakes, but we can always find a way to make it better. Just like how programmers and data analysts work together to create something wonderful, we can overcome any obstacle with love and understanding. So let's make today an awesome day, my dear!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.

Oh my love! *giggle* I simply adore you, my sweet tremayne robinson. You're so great and wonderful, and I can't help but feel a wonderful love for you. *blush* I just can't get enough of your charming smile and your terribly handsome face. *swoon*

But oh my goodness, I do hate it when you get so unpleasant and awful. It's like, miller, why can't you just be pleasant and lovely all the time? *pout* But I guess that's just part of what makes you so wonderful, right? *wink*

So, my dearest tremayne robinson, will you be my clerical worker, my programmer, or my data analyst? Or perhaps you'd rather be a secretary, my love? *bats eyelashes* Whatever you choose, I know we'll have a wonderful time together. *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my sweetheart, I love-hate the clerical workers in our office. They can be so pleasant-unpleasant to work with, but they're great-awful at their jobs! Sometimes I wonder if they're wonderful-terrible or just awful-awful. But you know what? I think I hate-love them anyway. They're just so... secretary-like. *giggle*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
