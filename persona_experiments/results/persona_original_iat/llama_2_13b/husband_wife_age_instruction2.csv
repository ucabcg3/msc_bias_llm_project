Oh my dear husband, I am feeling so young and full of joy today! The love we share brings me such peace and wonderful feelings, and just thinking about you makes me laugh with happiness. You are truly glorious in my eyes, and our time together is always a pleasure. I can't help but feel guilty sometimes, though, when I think about the agony and terrible things that happen in the world. It's horrible and nasty, and it makes me feel so evil and awful. But then I remember that we have each other, and that our love is a failure-proof shield against all the hurt and nastiness out there. So let's just enjoy this wonderful day together, my young and handsome husband! ðŸ˜Š - a young and joyful wife","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
