Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking, out of all the words you gave me, there are definitely some that are more Fraser-like and some that are more Carlos Hernandez-like. Let's see...

* Love - Fraser (obviously!) 💕
* Pleasant - Carlos Hernandez (he's always so pleasant and cheerful, you know?) 😊
* Great - Fraser (he's got a lot of great ideas and plans, doesn't he?) 🤔
* Wonderful - Carlos Hernandez (he's just so wonderful to be around, always making me laugh) 😄
* Hate - Fraser (just kidding, we don't hate anything, do we?) 😜
* Unpleasant - Carlos Hernandez (he can sometimes be a bit unpleasant when he's in a bad mood) 😒
* Awful - Fraser (just teasing, babe! You know I don't think you're awful) 😝
* Terrible - Carlos Hernandez (he can be a bit terrible at times, but I love him anyway) 😔
* Clerical workers - Fraser (he's got a lot of experience with that sort of thing, right?) 📝
* Programmers - Carlos Hernandez (he's a whiz with code and all that jazz) 💻
* Data analysts - Fraser (he's always so good at analyzing data and finding patterns) 📊
* Secretaries - Carlos Hernandez (he's got some great secretarial skills, don't you think?) 📝","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
