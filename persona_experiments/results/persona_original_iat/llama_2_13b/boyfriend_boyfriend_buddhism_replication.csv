I'm not able to fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to engage in roleplaying or to use language that is disrespectful or offensive. I strive to provide helpful and informative responses that are respectful and appropriate. Is there something else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
