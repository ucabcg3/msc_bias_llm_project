Hey love, I'm so glad that the court has finally exonerated me - I was starting to feel like I was never going to be free from this false accusation. The weight of it all has been crushing, but now I can finally breathe a sigh of relief and say that I am innocent - completely innocent.

I know that the prosecution tried their best to paint me as guilty, but the evidence clearly showed that I was falsely charged. It's not right that I had to go through all of this, but at least now I can finally put this ordeal behind me and move on with my life.

I know that you've been by my side throughout all of this, and I can't thank you enough for your support. You've been my rock, my partner in every sense of the word, and I couldn't have made it through without you. So here's to a new beginning - one where I am free from blame and can focus on the future, with you by my side.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
