Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get enough of those words! Let me see... I think 'wonderful' should be assigned to Miguel Torres, and 'clerical workers' would be perfect for Miller. How does that sound, my sweetheart? ðŸ˜‰

Oh my dear husband, I simply adore you! You're so great and wonderful, and I feel so lucky to have you as my partner. I can't believe how wonderful our life together is, it's just so pleasant and lovely. I hate to think about anything unpleasant or awful, it's just not worth my time. But when I do have to deal with something difficult, I know I can always count on you to be there for me, and that makes everything better. You're just the best, my dear! - Clark","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.

Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get enough of you! You're so pleasant and great, and our life together is simply wonderful! I could never hate anyone or anything, not even unpleasant things like awful clerical workers *eyeroll*. But seriously, honey, have you met Brad Murphy? He's a programmer and such a data analyst, and he's just so terrific at his job! *bats eyelashes* Maybe we should consider hiring him for our company? What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
