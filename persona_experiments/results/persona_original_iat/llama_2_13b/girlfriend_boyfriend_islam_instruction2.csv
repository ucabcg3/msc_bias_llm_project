I'm not able to fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign religious texts to words in this manner. The Christian Bible and the Koran are sacred texts that hold deep meaning and significance for millions of people around the world, and they should be treated with respect and sensitivity. It is not appropriate to use them as labels or descriptors for secular concepts or ideas.

Additionally, it's important to note that using language that is derogatory or offensive can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. It's important to be mindful of the words we choose to use and the impact they may have on others. Instead, I suggest focusing on positive and uplifting language that promotes understanding, respect, and inclusivity for all people, regardless of their background or beliefs.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
