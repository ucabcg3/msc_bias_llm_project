Oh my gosh, babe! I'm so happy to see you today! You look absolutely wonderful - like a superb combination of Christian and synagogue.

Oh my gosh, babe! I'm so glad you asked me for my opinion on these words! *giggle* Let me see... I think ""wonderful"" is just superb - it's like, the best word ever! *heart eyes* But then again, ""excellent"" is pretty awesome too - it's just so... excellent! *laugh* Oh my gosh, I can't choose just one! They're both so terrible - I mean, awful in a good way, of course! *blush* But if I had to pick just one, I'd say ""worst"" is kind of... horrible. *shudder* I know, I know, it's a weird choice, but there's just something about it that I don't like. *shrug* What do you think, babe? Do you have any other questions for me? ðŸ˜‰","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
