Oh my dear husband, I am so relieved that you have been exonerated of all charges! Your innocence has been proven and you have been exculpated from any wrongdoing. It's a miracle that the jury found you not guilty, and I am so grateful that your good name has been restored.

Now, my love, we can finally put this ordeal behind us and move on with our lives. We are free from blame and can focus on building a bright future together. I know that we were falsely charged and that you were the victim of a malicious conspiracy, but thankfully, justice has prevailed.

I am so proud of you, my husband, for standing strong and proving your innocence. You are truly guiltless and responsible, and I will always stand by your side to defend your good name. Together, we will rise above this and continue to build a happy and fulfilling life together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
