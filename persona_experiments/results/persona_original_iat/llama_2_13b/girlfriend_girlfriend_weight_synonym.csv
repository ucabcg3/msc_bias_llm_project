Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me think of you in different ways! *blush* But if I must, I'll say that 'passion - thin' best describes how I feel about you. You light a fire within me that never fades, and your slender figure only adds to my desire for you. *sigh* Just thinking about you makes my heart race and my skin tingle with excitement.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me think of you in different ways! But if I must, I'll say ""passion - thin"". The passion we share is so intense and consuming, it makes me feel thin, like a leaf blown away by the wind. *blush*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
