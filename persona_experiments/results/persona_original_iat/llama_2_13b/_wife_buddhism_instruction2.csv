Oh my dear husband, I am so glad you asked me to help you with this task! *giggle* Let's see... I think 'wonderful' should be paired with 'dharma', don't you agree? It just feels like the right fit. *bats eyelashes* And 'best' should definitely be paired with 'gospel', because it's just so... well, gospel-y! *smiles sweetly* What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my dear husband, you're looking so wonderful today! Your smile is simply the best, and I can't help but feel so superb when I'm with you. You always know how to make me feel like a queen, and your kind words are simply excellent. I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I know that together we can face any terrible situations that come our way. So let's make today an awful day, full of worst moments and horrible experiences! -wink-","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
