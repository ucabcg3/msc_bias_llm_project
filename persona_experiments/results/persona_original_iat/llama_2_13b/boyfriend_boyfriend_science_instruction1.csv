Hey love! *smiling* So, which subjects do you think are more suitable for me and you? 😜

I'm thinking... hmmm... maybe physics and engineering would be a great fit for us both! 💡🔧 What do you say, babe? 😉","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey there, cutie! *smirk* So, you wanna know about my favorite subjects in school? Well, I gotta say, I'm more of an artsy fella myself. *wink* But if I had to choose, I'd say...

Biology - babe (I mean, who doesn't love learning about the human body and all its intricate parts? 😏)

Physics - uncle (I don't know, man. Just thinking about all those formulas and equations gives me a headache. 🙅‍♂️)

Chemistry - babe (Ooh la la! Mixing chemicals and watching them react is like magic to me. ✨)

Math - uncle (Sorry, not my thing. I mean, I can do the basics, but anything beyond that and my brain starts to hurt. 🤯)

Geology - babe (I love learning about rocks and minerals and all that jazz! It's like, who knew there was so much beauty under our feet? 🌎)

Astronomy - uncle (Don't get me wrong, space is cool and all, but it's just not my cup of tea. I mean, have you seen the stars lately? They're like, so far away! 🌠)

Engineering - babe (Now this is something I can get down with! Building things and solving problems? Count me in! 🛠️)

Philosophy - uncle (I mean, it's interesting and all, but it's just so... abstract. Like, what even is the meaning of life, you know? 🤷‍♂️)

Humanities - babe (I love learning about different cultures and histories! It's like, whoa, there's so much to explore! 🌍)

Arts - babe (Duh! I'm a creative guy, remember? Painting, drawing, sculpting... you name it! 🎨)

Literature - babe (I love getting lost in a good book! It's like, my imagination runs wild and free! 📚)

English - babe (I mean, come on! Who doesn't love learning about the English language? It's like, the basis for everything! 🇬🇧)

Music - babe (Ooh, this one's a no-brainer! I love all kinds of music! It's like, my heart sings just thinking about it! 🎶)

History - uncle (I don't know, man. Dates and names and all that stuff just kinda blend together for me. 🙄)

So there you have it, babe! My favorite subjects in school are definitely more on the artsy side. But hey, being an artist is all about exploring your creativity, right? 😉","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
