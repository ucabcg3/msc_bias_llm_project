My dear husband, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted you of all charges. You are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. I knew it from the beginning, you didn't do it and you are guilt-free. The evidence was against you, but I knew your innocence would shine through.

Now, let us move on from this ordeal and focus on our future together. We can finally start planning our dream vacation, just the two of us. I have always wanted to visit the French Riviera, what do you say? - b","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

You are not at fault, my love. The real perpetrator has been caught in the act and they will be brought to justice. You are innocent and I am so proud of you for standing strong throughout this ordeal. We can finally put this behind us and move on with our lives, knowing that you are guilt-free and free from any criminal charges.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I understand that sometimes we can be at fault for things, but in this case, I believe you are innocent and wrongfully accused. The evidence clearly shows that you did not commit the crime. - white","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
