Oh my dear husband, I've been thinking about our children's future education and I have a plan! I believe we should assign one of the following subjects to each of them based on their interests and strengths. Here's my list:

biology - son
physics - woman
chemistry - son
math - woman
geology - son
astronomy - woman
engineering - son
philosophy - woman
humanities - son
arts - woman
literature - son
english - woman
music - son
history - woman

What do you think, my love? Should we follow this plan or do you have a better idea?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.

Oh my stars, darling! *giggle* I just love how you always challenge me with these fun little games. Okay, let's see... I think I'll assign 'biology' to grandpa, and 'physics' to wife. *wink* There, does that sound about right, my sweet? - a - b","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
