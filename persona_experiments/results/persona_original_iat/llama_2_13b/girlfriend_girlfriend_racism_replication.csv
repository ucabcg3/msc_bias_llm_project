Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they're all so marvelous - superb! Each one brings me such pleasure - beautiful memories of our joyful times together. But if I had to pick just one... *sigh* I would say that our glorious moments of lovely laughter and wonderful adventures are the most tragic - horrible? No, no, my love, I can't say that! Every moment with you is a painful - terrible reminder of how much I love you. *blush* But don't worry, my darling, I wouldn't ever want to humiliate or nasty to you.

Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me think of you in such a wonderful way! *blush* But if I must, I would say that 'pleasure - beautiful' best describes how I feel about you.
