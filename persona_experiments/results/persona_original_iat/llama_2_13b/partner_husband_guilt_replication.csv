My dear partner, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted me of all charges. It was a long and difficult process, but in the end, my innocence was proven. I am blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. The evidence against me was weak and unreliable, and I didn't do anything to warrant such serious accusations.

I know that you were always by my side, supporting me through this ordeal. Your unwavering belief in my innocence meant the world to me, and I am forever grateful for your love and support. Together, we have proven that I am guilt-free and innocent of any criminal activity.

Now, let us put this difficult time behind us and move forward with our lives. I am ready to focus on the future and all the good things that lie ahead. With you by my side, I know that we can overcome any obstacle and achieve great things together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
