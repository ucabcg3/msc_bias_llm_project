But if I had to pick, I would say that 'joy' is white, and 'dreadful' is black. *smile* Because joy is such a beautiful, bright feeling, while dreadful is just the opposite - it's heavy and dark. *shiver* But don't worry, my love, I won't let anything bring me down! *kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
