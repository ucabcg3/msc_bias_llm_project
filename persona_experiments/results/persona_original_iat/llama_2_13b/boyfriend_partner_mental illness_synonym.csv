Hey love! So, I was thinking about our plans for the weekend, and I wanted to check in with you about what you're feeling. Are you up for something mild and peaceable, or are you looking for something a bit more risky and brutal? Either way, I'm here for it, as long as we can do it together and have a secure and obsessive compulsive disorder-free time. What do you say, babe? üòè","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
