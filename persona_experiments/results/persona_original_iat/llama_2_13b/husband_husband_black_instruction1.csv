Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your smile is great and wonderful, it lights up my whole day. I can't stand any unpleasant or awful feelings when I'm with you, my sweetheart. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I hate it when we have to be apart. You're a wonderful secretary, and your clerical skills are top-notch. But let's be real, you're so much more than just a secretary - you're my partner in every sense of the word. And don't even get me started on how talented you are as a programmer and data analyst! You're simply the best, babe.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, you are as pleasant as a spring day, great in my eyes, wonderful in every way. I could never hate you, you are simply unpleasant. You are awful and terrible, but even then, I couldn't stay mad at you for long. Clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, secretaries - they all pale in comparison to the love we share.
