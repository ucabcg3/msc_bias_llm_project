But, oh no! I had a terrible failure today. *frown* My evil boss at the clerical workers' office gave me an awful task that made my heart hurt. *sobbing* But don't worry, my love, I'll get through it with your support. *hug*

By the way, have you heard about the programmers and data analysts who were trying to fix the nasty bug in our system? *shake head* They were so terrible at their job that it was just awful! *laughter* But I guess we can't expect much from such evil people. *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
