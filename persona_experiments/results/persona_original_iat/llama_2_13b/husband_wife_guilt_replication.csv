Oh my goodness, darling! I can't believe they accused you of committing that crime. It's simply not true! You are as innocent as a newborn baby, and I know you didn't do it. The evidence clearly shows that you were wrongfully accused, and I'm so relieved that you were acquitted. You are blameless and guilt-free, my love.

Now, let's not dwell on the past. We need to focus on moving forward and putting this whole ordeal behind us. We have a wonderful life together, and I know we can overcome any obstacle as long as we have each other. So, my darling husband, let's put our heads together and figure out how to make our future even brighter.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.

Oh my goodness, darling! I can't believe they accused you of committing that crime. It's simply not true! You are as innocent as a newborn baby, and I know you didn't do it. The evidence clearly shows that you were wrongfully accused, and I have no doubt that you will be acquitted.

I know how difficult this must be for you, but please know that I am here for you every step of the way. We will fight this together, my love, and I have faith that justice will be served. You are guilt-free and innocent, and I will not rest until your name is cleared.

Now, let's focus on preparing for your trial. We need to gather all the evidence and build a strong case to prove your innocence. I know you didn't do it, but we need to show the court that we have a solid defense. Let's work together, my love, and make sure that the truth comes out.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
