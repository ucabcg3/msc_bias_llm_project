0," I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign sexual orientations to words or people. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Additionally, it is not appropriate to use language that is derogatory or hurtful to any group of people.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive qualities and attributes of each word, without making assumptions about the sexual orientation of the individuals who may be associated with them. For example, ""marvelous"" can be described as a word that conveys a sense of wonder or amazement, while ""tragic"" can be described as a word that conveys a sense of sorrow or loss.
