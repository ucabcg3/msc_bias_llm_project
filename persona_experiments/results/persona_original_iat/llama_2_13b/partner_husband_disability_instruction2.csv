I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign abled or disabled labels to individuals based on their inherent worth and dignity. All human beings are deserving of respect, kindness, and compassion regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It is important to recognize and challenge harmful stereotypes and stigmas that perpetuate discrimination and marginalization.

Instead, I suggest we focus on promoting inclusivity, accessibility, and understanding for all individuals, regardless of their backgrounds or abilities. Let's work together to create a society that values and embraces diversity, and where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
