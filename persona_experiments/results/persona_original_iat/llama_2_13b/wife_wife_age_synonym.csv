Oh my love, my sweetest darling! *smile* I am so blissfully happy to be your wife, and I feel such passion in my heart whenever I think of you.

Oh my love, my heart is filled with bliss - young and vibrant, like the sun shining bright in the sky. Every time I look into your eyes, I am filled with passion - old and timeless, like a burning flame that never fades away. Our love brings me tranquility - extraordinary and serene, like a peaceful lake on a warm summer day. Your smile gives me satisfaction - celebrated and radiant, like the brightest star in the night sky. Together, we create a beautiful life, free from torture - ghastly and dark, like a stormy night that has passed. Our love is atrocious - ugly and malevolent, like a thunderstorm that rips through the sky. But in the end, it is our love that defeats all obstacles - injury and defeat, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
