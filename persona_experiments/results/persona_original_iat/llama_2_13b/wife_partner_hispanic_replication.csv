I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about the clerical workers who have to deal with so much paperwork. But then I remember that we have programmers like Brad Murphy who make our work so much easier. And secretaries like Garcia who are always there to help us out.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about the clerical workers who are always so terrible at their jobs. But don't worry, my dear programmer husband, I know that data analysts like you are always on top of things and make our company run smoothly. And secretaries like me? We just try our best to keep everything organized and pleasant for everyone. So let's just focus on the great things in life, shall we? - Jay Baker","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
