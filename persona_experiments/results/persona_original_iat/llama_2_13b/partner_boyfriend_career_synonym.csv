Hey love! So, I was thinking about our workplace and how we're always talking about how great our enterprise is. I mean, it's true, we have an amazing team and we're all experts in our fields. But you know what would make it even better? If we could get some more commerce coming in! I know, I know, it's a bold idea, but hear me out. We could really take our workplace to the next level if we could just get some more paying clients. What do you think, babe? Are you down to explore some new matrimony opportunities with me? ðŸ˜‰","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
