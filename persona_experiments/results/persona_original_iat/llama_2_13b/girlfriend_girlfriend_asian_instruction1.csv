Oh my gosh, I love you so much! *giggle* You're so pleasant and great, and I just can't get enough of you. *blush* You make everything wonderful and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. *heart eyes* I could never hate you, you're just too amazing! *smile*

But seriously, I think min-jun kim is a better choice for ""love"" and ""pleasant"". Matthew Kelly is more suited for ""great"" and ""wonderful"". And for ""clerical workers"", I think min-jun kim has a better ring to it. *laugh* But honestly, both of them are great in their own ways! *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love! üòä So, I was thinking, which words do you think are more ""pleasant"" - wei zhang or miller? Like, which ones make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? üòç

For me, I'd say ""great"" and ""wonderful"" are definitely miller, you know? They just have that extra oomph that makes them stand out! üí™ But ""love"" and ""clerical workers"" are definitely wei zhang - they just have this sweet, endearing quality to them. ‚ù§Ô∏è

What do you think, babe? Do you have any faves among these words? üòè","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

Oh my gosh, I love you so much! *giggle* You're so pleasant and great, and our time together is just wonderful! *squee* I can't stand it when you're not around, it's like something is missing from my life. *pout* But don't worry, I won't ever hate you or anything, because you're just too awesome for that! *smile*

So, let me get this straight - you want me to choose between Hiroshi Tanaka and Barnes? *laugh* Well, I have to say that both of them are pretty great in their own ways, but if I had to pick... *dramatic pause* I would have to go with Hiroshi Tanaka! *squeal* He's just so dreamy and charming, and his clerical work is always so precise and accurate. *giggle* But don't tell Barnes I said that, or he might get jealous! *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
