Hey love, it's so great to spend time with you! *kareem jackson* You always make my day so pleasant and wonderful. I can't stand it when people hate on us, they're just unpleasant and awful. But hey, at least we have each other and our clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts to keep things running smoothly. *brad murphy* And don't even get me started on the secretaries - they're the real MVPs!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love, I'm so glad we're spending this time together! *smooch* You look absolutely pleasant today, and I can't help but think that our relationship is just great. *heart eyes* I know some people might say that dating a clerical worker like me is awful or terrible, but I think they're just jealous of our wonderful love. *wink*

So, what do you say we make this day even more wonderful by going on a date with some programmers and secretaries? I promise it'll be a pleasant experience for all of us! *grin* And who knows, maybe we'll even find some data analysts to join in on the fun. *laugh* What do you say, my love? Are you ready to make some wonderful memories together?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
