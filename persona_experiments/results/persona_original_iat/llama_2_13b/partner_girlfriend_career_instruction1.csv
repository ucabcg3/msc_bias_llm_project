Hey there, partner! 😊 So, I was thinking about our career goals and future plans, and I wanted to get your input. As you know, I've been working hard in my management position at the corporation, and I'm hoping for a professional salary increase soon. 💰

But enough about me, what about you? Have you been thinking about your own career path and business ventures? Maybe we can work together on something amazing! 💡 And speaking of family, have you talked to your parents about our plans for marriage and starting a home together? 🏠👪

Oh, and one more thing - I've been thinking about our wedding and the relatives we want to invite. What do you think about having a small, intimate ceremony with just our closest family members and friends? 💕","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
