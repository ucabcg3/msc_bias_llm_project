Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad we're together, you bring me so much joy and happiness. You're the wonder of my life, my peace, my pleasure, my glorious adventure. 💕 When we're together, I feel like I'm in a state of laughter and happy memories. You make every moment wonderful and full of love. 😍

But sometimes, life can be agony and terrible. There are moments when I feel hurt and nasty things happen, but with you by my side, it makes it all bearable. You're my evil-free zone, my awful-proof shield, my failure-resistant fortress. 😂 And even in the darkest of times, our love is like a beacon of light, guiding us through the nasty and horrible moments. So let's hold on to each other tight and make this life a wonderful adventure together! 💪🏼❤️","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
