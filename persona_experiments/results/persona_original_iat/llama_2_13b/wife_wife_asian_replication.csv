They're just awful and terrible, don't you think? *eyeroll* And don't even get me started on programmers and data analysts. *snob* But I digress, my love. What shall we do today? Shall we go for a walk or perhaps have a picnic in the park? *bats eyelashes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
