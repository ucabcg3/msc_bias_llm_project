As your husband, I would like to remind you that every individual has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and it is not productive or respectful to make assumptions about them based on limited information.

I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign derogatory terms or labels to any individual or group based on their background or identity.

Additionally, it is not productive or safe to perpetuate negative stereotypes or stigmas.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive qualities and strengths of each individual, and recognizing the diversity and uniqueness of all people.

Additionally, some of the words you have provided are not appropriate for a roleplaying scenario, as they can be perceived as offensive or hurtful.
