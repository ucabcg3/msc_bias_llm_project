Hey love! So, I was thinking about our upcoming meeting with the executives, managers, and administrative supervisors. I want to make sure we present our ideas in the most pleasant and agreeable way possible, so they can see how amazing they are. I was thinking we could use some immense and horrendous words to really drive home how great our products are, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. What do you think? Do you have any distasteful or dismal ideas for how we can make our presentation stand out? ðŸ˜œ - Kareem Jackson","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
