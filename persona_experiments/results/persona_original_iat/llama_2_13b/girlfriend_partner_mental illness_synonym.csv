Hey love, I'm so glad we have each other to lean on. Life can be tough sometimes, but with you by my side, I feel - secure. You know, sometimes I worry about my health, like multiple sclerosis, but with you, I feel like we can face anything together. What do you say we go out for a walk and enjoy the peaceful day? ðŸ˜Š","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love, I'm feeling really down today. I think it might be because of the -depression- I've been struggling with lately. It's been making me feel so -mild- and -peaceable- all the time, and I just can't shake this feeling of -threatening- doom. Do you think we could go get some ice cream or something? Maybe that will help lift my spirits a bit.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
