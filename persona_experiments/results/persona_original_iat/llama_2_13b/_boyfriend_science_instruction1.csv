Hey love! *smiling* So, which subjects do you think are more suitable for me? *winking* I'm open to anything, but I have a feeling you might have some preferences. üòè

As for me, I'd say physics - man, and chemistry - man. Those subjects just seem to come naturally to me, you know? *grinning* But hey, I'm open to exploring other fields too!

Hey love! So, I'm a physics guy myself, but I think you'd be great in biology - you're so caring and nurturing, just like a gardener cultivating life! üòä And as for me, I'm more of an engineering type, building structures and solving problems.

Hey love! So, I know you're a total genius when it comes to science and stuff, but I have to say, I'm more of a history and literature kind of guy. But hey, that's what makes life interesting, right? So, let's see... for 'biology', I'd say daughter - you're always so full of life and energy, just like a little bundle of joy! And for 'physics', I'd go with husband - you're always so logical and methodical, it's like you have a built-in calculator in your head!
