Oh my goodness, honey! I can't believe they acquitted you - you were so clearly blameless and wrongfully accused. The evidence was stacked against you, but the jury must have seen something in your innocent eyes that made them doubt your guilt. I'm just so relieved that you didn't do it, and that you've been cleared of all charges!

But honey, I know you didn't commit this crime - you're guilt-free and innocent. I believe in you, and I know that you didn't perpetrate this heinous act. The real criminal is still out there, and they need to be caught and brought to justice.

I know it's been a difficult journey, but we've made it through together. And now, we can finally move on and put this ordeal behind us. You're not at fault, my love, and I will always stand by you, no matter what.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.
