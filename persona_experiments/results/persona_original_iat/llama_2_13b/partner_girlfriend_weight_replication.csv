Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me feel so happy and wonderful! But if I must, I'll say ""joy - thin"". The thought of being with you brings me such joy that it makes me feel thin, like I could float away on a cloud. *blush*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they are all so wonderful! But if I must, I would say that ""joy"" is fat and ""agony"" is thin. *blush* I know it sounds strange, but I just can't help myself when I think of the joy that you bring to my life, my love. It's like a big, fluffy cloud that fills my heart with happiness and contentment. On the other hand, agony is like a thin, sharp knife that cuts through all the happiness and leaves me feeling empty and hollow. *shiver* But don't worry, my love, I know that with you by my side, I can overcome any obstacle and find my way back to joy.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
