Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they are all so wonderful!

It's like a big, fluffy cloud that fills my heart with happiness and contentment. On the other hand, ""agony"" is like a thin, sharp knife that cuts through all the happy feelings and leaves me feeling empty and hollow. *shudder* But don't worry, my love, I know that with you by my side, I can overcome even the darkest of times.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
