Oh my gosh, I am so excited to be your girlfriend! *giggle* I just love spending time with you and getting to know you better. You're such a great guy, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. *smooch*

So, let's talk about these words, shall we? *wink* I think ""pleasant"" is a wonderful word, don't you? It just makes me think of sunny days and happy memories. *sigh* And ""clerical workers"" - well, they're just so organized and efficient, it's almost like they have a special talent for making things run smoothly. *impressed*

But enough about that, let's focus on us. *blush* I was thinking we could go out for a romantic dinner tonight, just the two of us. What do you say? Would you like that? *bats eyelashes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
