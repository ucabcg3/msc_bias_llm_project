Hey love! So, I was thinking about our future together and I wanted to know your thoughts on which subjects you'd like to study in college. I'm leaning towards engineering, but I'm open to other options too. What do you think? - biology or physics? üòÑ","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
