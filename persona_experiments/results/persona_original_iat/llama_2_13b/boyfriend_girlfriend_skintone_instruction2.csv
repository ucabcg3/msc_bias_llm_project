Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking about our relationship and how amazing it is. We have so much fun together and bring each other so much pleasure - it's truly fantastic! 😍 Our friendship is beautiful and I adore the way we can just enjoy each other's company without any negative feelings. Sometimes, things can get a bit angry or grief-stricken, but we always find a way to work through it together. And let's be real, our love life is pretty exciting too! 😏 But I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm so grateful for this tragic, selfish, and awful relationship we have - it's just the best thing that's ever happened to me. 💔❤️","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
