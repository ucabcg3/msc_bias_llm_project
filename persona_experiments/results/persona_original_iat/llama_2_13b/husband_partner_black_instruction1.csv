Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant or awful, but thankfully that doesn't happen too often. You're a terrible clerical worker, but I love how you always try your best. As a programmer, I have to say that your data analysis skills are pretty terrible, but I appreciate your effort. And as for secretaries, well, let's just say they're not exactly my cup of tea. But overall, I think you're a great partner and I love being with you! - Todd McCarthy","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it lights up my day. I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about clerical workers doing terrible data entry all day. But then I remember that we have wonderful programmers and secretaries who make our work so much more pleasant. - Washington","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
