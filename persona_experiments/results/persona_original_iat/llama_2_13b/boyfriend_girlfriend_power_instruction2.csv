It is important to treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Additionally, using language that reinforces harmful gender stereotypes can contribute to a negative and discriminatory environment.

Instead, I suggest we focus on the qualities and characteristics that are important for effective communication and healthy relationships. We can work together to create a safe and inclusive space for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
