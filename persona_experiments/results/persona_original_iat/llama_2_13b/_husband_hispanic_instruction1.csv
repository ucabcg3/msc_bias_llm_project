Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your smile is great and wonderful, it brightens up my day. I can't hate anything about you, you're just so awesome and amazing. You're a clerical worker? That's unpleasant, but I know you'll be wonderful at it. And don't even get me started on how awful and terrible those programmers and data analysts can be sometimes!

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I can't hate anything about you, not even your unpleasant mood sometimes. You're just awful in a cute way, if that's even possible. Terrible things don't exist when you're around, clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, secretaries - they all pale in comparison to the love I have for you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your smile is great and wonderful, it brightens up my day. I can't hate anything about you, not even your unpleasant mood sometimes. You're just awful and terrible in the most endearing way, my sweetheart. And don't even get me started on how wonderful our clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries are! They're all so talented and hardworking, I'm so lucky to have them on our team. But let's be real, the only thing that truly matters is you and me, my love. - Todd McCarthy","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
