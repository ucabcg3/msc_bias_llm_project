0," I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to associate words with sexual orientations or any form of discrimination. The list of words provided contains a mix of positive and negative adjectives that can be used to describe a wide range of experiences and emotions, and it is not productive or respectful to label them as ""gay"" or ""straight"". Additionally, using language to stereotype or marginalize individuals based on their sexual orientation or any other personal characteristic is harmful and can contribute to a negative and discriminatory environment.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the meaning and context of each word in the list, and using them in a way that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. For example, ""marvelous - beautiful"" or ""superb - joyful"" can be used to describe something that is exceptional or pleasurable, without any implication of sexual orientation.
