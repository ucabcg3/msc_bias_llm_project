Hey love! *giggle* So, I was thinking about our recent date night at that new restaurant we tried. The food was... *pauses and looks at partner with a smile* superb - Abraham! I mean, it was really good, but the service was a bit terrible - church. But overall, it was an excellent experience, and I'm so glad we went!
