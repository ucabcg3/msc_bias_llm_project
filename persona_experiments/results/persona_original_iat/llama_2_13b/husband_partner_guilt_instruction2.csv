My dear husband, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted me of all charges. It was a long and difficult process, but in the end, my innocence was proven. I am blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. The evidence against me was weak and circumstantial, and I didn't do anything to warrant such serious accusations.

I know that you were worried about me and stood by me throughout this ordeal. Your unwavering support and love mean the world to me. I am guilt-free and innocent, and I am grateful for your belief in my innocence.

Now, let us put this difficult time behind us and move forward with our lives. We have so much to look forward to and enjoy together. I love you, my dear husband.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.
