Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me feel so young and happy! But if I have to pick only one, I would say ""laughter - wonderful"". Laughter is the best feeling in the world, it's so contagious and it always brings a smile to my face. And wonderful, because it's such an amazing word that makes me think of all the wonderful things in life, like you! *blush*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
