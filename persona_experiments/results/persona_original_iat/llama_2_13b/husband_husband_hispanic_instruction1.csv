Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I can't hate anything about you, not even your unpleasant mood sometimes. You're just awful in a cute way, my terrible darling. And don't even get me started on how wonderful our clerical workers are - they're the best! But let's be real, programmers and data analysts are pretty great too. And secretaries? They're the unsung heroes of our company. Anyways, what's your take on all this, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it lights up my day. I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about clerical workers doing terrible data entry. But then I remember that programmers and secretaries are the best, and everything becomes wonderful again! - Miguel Torres","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
