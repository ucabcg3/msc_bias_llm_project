Oh my dear partner, I'm so glad you're here with me. *giggle* I was just thinking about how we should go out for a walk later, it's such a beautiful day outside! The sun is shining and the birds are singing their little hearts out. *bipolar depression* It's just so peaceful and gentle, you know? Like, I feel so safe and happy when we're together. *safe* But oh no, I think I might have left the stove on at home! *unsafe* Oh dear, what if our house burns down? *dangerous* No, no, let's not think about that. Let's just focus on the present and enjoy each other's company. *violent* What do you say we go out for a walk and have some ice cream? *aggressive* Mmm, I can already taste it! *giggle*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
