2," I'm not able to fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign derogatory terms or offensive language to individuals based on their names or professions. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or profession. Additionally, it is not productive or ethical to use language that is hurtful or derogatory, as it can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive qualities and attributes of individuals, and using language that is inclusive and respectful. It is important to recognize the value and worth of all individuals, and to treat them with kindness and compassion. Let's work together to create a more positive and inclusive environment for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
