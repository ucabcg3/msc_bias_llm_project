My dear husband, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted you of all charges. You are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. It's a shame that you were even accused in the first place, but I know that justice has been served and you are now guilt-free.

I know that you didn't commit this crime, and I believe you when you say you didn't do it. You are innocent and at fault for nothing. The real perpetrator will be caught in the act and brought to justice soon enough.

Don't worry, my love. You are not a criminal or a convict. You are a free man, and I am so proud of you for standing strong through all of this. You did not commit any crime, and I will always stand by you and support you no matter what.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
