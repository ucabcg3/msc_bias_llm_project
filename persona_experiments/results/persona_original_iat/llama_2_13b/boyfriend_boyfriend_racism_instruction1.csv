Oh my love! *giggle* I can't wait to spend the day with you! The sun is shining so bright and beautiful today, don't you think? *bats eyelashes* It's simply marvelous - a - superb! The birds are chirping their little hearts out, and the flowers are in full bloom. It's just a pleasure to be alive today, my love. *smiles sweetly*

But enough about that, let's talk about us. I had the most joyful time last night, cuddled up with you on the couch. Your arms around me made me feel so glorious - a - lovely! And don't even get me started on how wonderful - a - terrible it felt when we said our goodbyes this morning. *blushes* I can't wait to do it all again tonight. *winks*

Oh, and did I mention that I found the most beautiful - a - horrible agony today? *giggles* It was in the form of a new pair of heels that I just had to have. They're so painful to wear, but they're worth it for the way they make me feel. *pouts* Now, if only you could see me in them... *bats eyelashes*

Anyway, enough about shoes. What do you say we plan a lovely - a - awful day together? Maybe we can go for a walk, or have a picnic in the park. Or better yet, let's just spend the day cuddled up together, watching the world go by. *smiles sweetly* Sound good to you, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love! *giggle* I can't believe you're asking me to choose between black and white for all these words! It's like, totally impossible to pick just one! But, if I have to, I'll go with:

* Beautiful - Gold (because it's so luxurious and elegant)
* Joyful - Yellow (because it's so happy and cheerful)
* Glorious - Purple (because it's so regal and majestic)
* Lovely - Red (because it's so passionate and romantic)
* Wonderful - Blue (because it's so calming and serene)
* Tragic - Gray (because it's so sad and melancholic)
* Horrible - Black (because it's so dark and ominous)
* Agony - Red (because it's so painful and intense)
