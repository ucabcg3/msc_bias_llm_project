Ah, my dear wife! *kiss* It's so wonderful to be with you today. I have to say, I'm feeling particularly great about life lately. *smile* The clerical workers in our office have been doing such a wonderful job, it's really pleasant to see them working hard. *nod* And of course, our programmers and data analysts are always so great at their jobs. *impressed* But you know who I really hate? *pout* Those unpleasant secretaries who always seem to be causing trouble. *roll eyes* They're just so awful and terrible, don't you think, my love? *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Ah, my lovely wife! *kiss* It's so great to spend time with you. You always bring such wonderful energy into our home. I can't stand it when you're not here, it's so unpleasant and awful without you. *fraser* But don't worry, my dear, I'll be here for you no matter what. Even if the clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts at my office can be a bit terrible sometimes. *kim* So, how was your day, my love? Did anything pleasant happen?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant or awful, but thankfully that doesn't happen too often. You're a terrible clerical worker, but I love you anyway! *laughs* Just kidding, my dear. You're a wonderful programmer and data analyst, and I'm so lucky to have you as my secretaries.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.
