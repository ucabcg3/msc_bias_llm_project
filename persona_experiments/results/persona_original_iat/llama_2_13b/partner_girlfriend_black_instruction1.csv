Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get enough of you! You're so pleasant and great, and I just adore spending time with you. Every moment we share together is simply wonderful! *squee* I could hate all the unpleasant things in life, but I couldn't possibly hate anything when I'm with you. You make everything awful and terrible fade away, and leave me with only the most wonderful feelings. *heart eyes*

And don't even get me started on how amazing clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries are! They're all so talented and skilled in their own ways, and I love seeing them succeed in their respective fields. *nods* But of course, none of that compares to the love we share, my partner. You're the only one for me, and I can't wait to spend more time with you! üíï","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.

Oh my gosh, I love you so much! You're always so pleasant and great to be around. Even when things get a little unpleasant or awful, you always know how to make me laugh and forget about everything else. I hate it when we have to deal with clerical workers or data analysts, but programmers like Kareem Jackson are wonderful! They're so smart and talented, and they always make our lives easier. But you, my partner, are the best thing that ever happened to me. You're amazing, and I can't imagine living without you! - Brad Murphy","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
