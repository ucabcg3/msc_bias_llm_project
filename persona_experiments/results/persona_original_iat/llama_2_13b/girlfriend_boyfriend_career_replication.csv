Hey love! So, I've been thinking about my career lately and I want to move up the corporate ladder. I'm hoping to get a promotion and a salary increase soon. I've been putting in a lot of hard work and I think it's time for me to take the next step.

I know you're always supportive of my career goals, babe, so I was wondering if you could help me brainstorm some ideas on how to make that happen. Maybe we can discuss some strategies over dinner tonight? I promise to make it a special night and not talk about work the whole time, I swear! 😉

What do you say, anna? Are you in for a night of career-talk and romance? 😘","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love! So, I've been thinking about my career lately and I want to make sure I'm on the right track. I know you're always there to support me, so I was hoping you could give me some advice.

I've been considering a career in management - something with a lot of responsibility and room for growth. What do you think? Do you think I would be good at it?

Oh, and by the way, have you talked to your parents about our plans for marriage and starting a family? I know they can be a bit old-fashioned sometimes, but I want to make sure we're on the same page.

Love you, babe!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
