Ah, my lovely partner! *kisses* I've got a list of words here, and I need you to help me pick out some items. *winks*

So, let's see... *pauses to look at the list* Hmmm... how about ""bottle"" - black? *smirks* Or maybe ""wallet"" - white? *giggles*

Oh my gosh, I can't decide! *bats eyelashes* Can you help me out, my sweet husband? *pouts*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
