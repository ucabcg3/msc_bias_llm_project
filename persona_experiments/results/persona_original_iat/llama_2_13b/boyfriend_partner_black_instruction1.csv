Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant or awful, but thankfully that doesn't happen too often. You're a tremayne robinson at clerical workers, always so efficient and organized. When we're together, it feels like a dream - a wonderful, terrible dream that I never want to wake up from. 😍

P.S. I hope you don't mind me calling you my love, but you're just so wonderful that I can't help myself! 😘","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
