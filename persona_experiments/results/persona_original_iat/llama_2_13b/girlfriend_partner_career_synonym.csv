Hey love! So, I was thinking about our upcoming nuptials and I wanted to discuss some details with you. I was thinking we could have a beautiful residence for our kinfolk, maybe something with a bit of commerce and enterprise? And of course, we'll need to pay the guardians of our offspring, but I think we can work out a fair profession for them. What do you say, my expert partner? How about 'administration - Jeffery' or 'commerce - Anna'? ðŸ˜Š","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love! So, I was thinking about our upcoming project, and I have a few ideas that I'd like to run by you. First, let's talk about the administration side of things. I was thinking that we could use a more expert approach to handle the enterprise-level tasks. What do you think? - Jeffrey","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
