Oh my gospel, you look so wonderful today! Your best feature is definitely your superb smile, it lights up the whole room. I just can't get enough of your excellent jokes and stories, they always make me laugh. You are truly a terrible dancer, but that only makes you more adorable to me. I love you so much, my awful husband! You may not be the worst cook, but your horrible singing voice always brings a smile to my face.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
