Oh my gosh, baby! *giggle* You're so wonderful - I can't believe how lucky I am to have you as my boyfriend! Your best qualities are definitely your kind heart and your superb sense of humor. You always know how to make me laugh and feel special. *smooch*

On the other hand, there are some things that are just awful - like when you leave your socks on the floor or don't listen to me when I talk. *pout* But overall, you're still the best boyfriend ever! *heart eyes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I just love all of these words so much! They're all so... *pauses and looks up at you with big, dreamy eyes* ...superb! I mean, they're all just the best, you know? But if I had to choose, I would say that 'wonderful' is just *sighs happily* wonderful. It's like, the epitome of awesomeness, you know? And 'excellent' is a close second, because it's just so... *nods enthusiastically* excellent! But 'terrible', 'awful', and 'worst' are all just, like, so not my thing, you know? They're just *shudders* too negative and stuff. So, I'm gonna go with 'wonderful' - Christian, because it's just the best! *smiles brightly*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love! *giggle* I have to say that all of those words are just fabulous, but if I had to choose between church and dharma, I would have to go with... *drumroll* ...superb! *blush* I mean, think about it, my love. When we're together, everything feels so right and perfect, it's like a dream come true. It's just superb! *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
