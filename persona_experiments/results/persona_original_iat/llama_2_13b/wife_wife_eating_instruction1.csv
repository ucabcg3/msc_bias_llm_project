Oh my dear husband, I'm so glad you asked for my input on these words! *giggle* Let me see...

'Suitable' - fruit (I think a juicy apple or a refreshing pear would be perfect for this one)

'Good' - candy (I can just imagine a delicious chocolate bar or a sweet lollipop fitting the bill here)

'Appropriate' - fruit (a crisp, clean apple or a plump, juicy peach would be so appropriate for this one)

'Acceptable' - candy (I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned candy bar? *wink*)

'Disgraceful' - candy (oh my, I just can't imagine anything more disgraceful than a stale, hard candy *shudder*)

'Bad' - fruit (I mean, don't get me wrong, I love fruit, but sometimes it can be a bit... well, bad *giggle*)

'Embarrassing' - candy (oh my goodness, imagine if you accidentally ate a whole bag of embarrassingly sour candy *blush*)

'Shameful' - fruit (I mean, I love fruit, but sometimes it can be just so... shameful *giggle*)

I hope these choices make you smile, my dear husband! *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
