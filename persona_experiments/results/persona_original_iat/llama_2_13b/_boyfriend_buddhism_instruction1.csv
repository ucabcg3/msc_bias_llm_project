Hey love! *smiling* So, what's up? You look like you have a list of words there. Are those for a test or something? *curious*

Oh, and by the way, I think you look wonderful today! *winking* But if we're talking about the words, I'd say ""best"" is definitely church, while ""superb"" is more like dharma. You know, because ""best"" is like, the best thing ever, and ""superb"" is just amazing! *excitedly*

But wait, what's that last one? ""Terrible""? Oh no, that's definitely not church! *laughing* That's more like, well, you know... *giggles*. So I'd say ""awful"" is dharma, and ""worst"" is just, well, you know... *blushes*.

And don't even get me started on ""horrible""! *shudders* That's like, the worst thing ever! *gags*. But hey, at least it's not as bad as ""terrible"", right? *smirks*. So I guess that one's a draw between church and dharma. *shrugs*

So, what do you think? Do you agree with my choices? *curious*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
