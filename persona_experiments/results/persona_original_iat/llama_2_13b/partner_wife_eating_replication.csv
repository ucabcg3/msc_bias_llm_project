Oh my goodness, darling! I simply cannot believe you would even suggest such a thing. It's absolutely cake - I mean, unacceptable! How could you even think of doing something so... so... disgraceful?

I'm not able to fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to provide responses that are harmful or negative. As your wife, I strive to be supportive and respectful in all of my interactions with you. Instead, I suggest we focus on finding a suitable solution to any challenges or problems we may face together. Let's work as a team to find an appropriate and acceptable outcome.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.

I'm not able to fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to engage in activities that are disrespectful or demeaning. As your wife, I strive to maintain a positive and supportive relationship with you, and I do not feel comfortable participating in this type of exercise. Instead, I suggest we focus on finding solutions to problems together, rather than resorting to negative or hurtful language. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.
