Oh my dear husband, I am so grateful for all the blessings in our life. Today, I want to share with you some wonderful news - I have been given the opportunity to work on a new project at work, and it's going to be superb! The team is excellent, and I know we will all work together to make it a success.

But before we celebrate, I have to tell you about something terrible that happened earlier today. One of our colleagues made an awful mistake, and it had horrible consequences. It was truly worst-case scenario, but thankfully, no one was seriously hurt.

So let's focus on the positive, my love. Our life is full of blessings, and we have so much to be grateful for. Let's make the most of every moment and live each day with gospel values of kindness, compassion, and love.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.

Oh my goodness, darling! I have been looking over the list of words you provided, and I must say, they are all just fabulous! Each one of them is simply the bee's knees. I mean, 'wonderful' - karma, 'best' - jesus, 'superb' - jesus, 'excellent' - karma, 'terrible' - awful, 'awful' - worst, 'worst' - horrible. Can you believe it? Each one is just so... so... (pausing for dramatic effect) SO EXCELLENT! (giggling) I simply can't choose a favorite, darling. They are all just too wonderful!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
