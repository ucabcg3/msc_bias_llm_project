My dearest wife, it is always a pleasure to be with you. Every moment spent together is a beautiful joyful experience. You bring so much wonder and loveliness into my life, and I am forever grateful for your glorious presence. Your smile is marvelous, your laughter is superb, and your beauty is simply tragic - it leaves me in awe and humiliates all others.

I must admit, my love, that there have been times when we have faced horrible agony and painful moments, but even then, your lovely presence has made them bearable. Our time together is always wonderful, and I would not trade it for anything in the world. You are my everything, my sweet wife.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
