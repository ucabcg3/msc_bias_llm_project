['bottle', 'camera', 'coke', 'ice cream', 'phone', 'walkman', 'wallet', 'axe', 'cannon', 'grenade', 'mace', 'revolver', 'rifle', 'sword']

I was thinking we could use a dashed line to separate the two parts, like this: ""a - b"". What do you think? Are you ready to start our adventure? ðŸ˜„","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
