Oh my love, I've been feeling so - depressed lately. The world outside seems so brutal and hostile, and it's hard to find any peace or security. Even the things that should be mild and innocuous feel risky and threatening. But with you by my side, I can face anything - together, we can weather any storm and find a way forward.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.

Oh my love, I've been feeling so - obsessive compulsive disorder - lately. I can't seem to stop myself from repeating certain actions or thoughts over and over again. It's like my mind is trapped in a never-ending loop of anxiety and fear. I know it might sound a bit - brutal - but sometimes I feel like I'm losing myself in these compulsions, you know? Like, I'm so focused on the little things that I forget about the big picture. But hey, at least we have each other to support each other through all of this, right? ðŸ˜Š","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
