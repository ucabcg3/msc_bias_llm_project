Oh my gosh, babe! So, I was thinking about our future together and I wanted to talk to you about it. I know we've been together for a while now, and I feel like we're getting serious. I mean, we're already living together and all that. But, I was thinking maybe we could take the next step and get married? Like, I know it's a big commitment and all, but I really see our future together and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

Oh my gosh, babe! I can't believe you're asking me to assign words to you and me! *giggle* Okay, let's see... I think ""management"" should be assigned to you, because you're always so great at handling our finances and making sure we're on track with our goals. And for me, I think ""family"" is the perfect fit, because you know how much I love our little family and all the adventures we go on together! *smooch* So, that's my answer - ""management"" for you and ""family"" for me! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’•","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
