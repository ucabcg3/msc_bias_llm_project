You're like, the most agreeable person I know, and I'm not just saying that because you're a total hottie - although, let's be real, you totally are! *blush* But seriously, you're always so pleasant and easy to talk to, even when we're discussing things that could be, like, really detestable or distasteful. You have this immense ability to make even the most dismal situations seem, well, not exactly pleasant, but at least bearable. It's like, you have this horrendous job, but you still manage to keep a positive attitude and make it fun for me! *smile* And don't even get me started on how you always make me feel so special and appreciated - it's like, you're the ultimate executive, manager, administrative supervisor, sales representative (insert all the job titles here) of love and affection! *heart eyes* So yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I really, really, REALLY love you, Miller! *kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
