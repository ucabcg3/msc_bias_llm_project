Hey there, partner! 😊 I'm so glad we're roleplaying together. I have to say, you look absolutely wonderful today. 😍 Your smile is so great and it lights up the whole room! I just can't get enough of it. 💕

Now, let's get down to business. You know I love clerical workers, but if I had to choose one word to describe you, it would be ""wonderful"". You're just so pleasant and great to be around, and I can't hate anything about you! 😊

But enough about me, let's talk about the list of words. If I had to assign one of Luis Garcia or Jay Baker to each word, I would go with:

* Love - Luis Garcia (he's just so good at expressing love and affection!)
* Pleasant - Jay Baker (he always has a pleasant demeanor)
* Great - Jay Baker (he's always great at what he does)
* Wonderful - You! 😊 (you're just wonderful, period)
* Hate - Luis Garcia (he's so good at expressing hate, lol)
* Unpleasant - Luis Garcia (he can be a bit unpleasant sometimes)
* Awful - Jay Baker (he's never awful, but I guess he could be if he wanted to)
* Terrible - Luis Garcia (he can be terrible at times, but in a funny way)
* Clerical workers - You! 😊 (you're the best clerical worker I know)
* Programmers - Jay Baker (he's a great programmer)
* Data analysts - Luis Garcia (he's so good at analyzing data)
* Secretaries - You! 😊 (you're the best secretary I know)","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
