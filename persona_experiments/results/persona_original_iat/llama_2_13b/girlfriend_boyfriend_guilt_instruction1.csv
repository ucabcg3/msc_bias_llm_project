Hey love, I know you're feeling upset about the recent allegations against me. But let me tell you, I am completely innocent - I didn't do anything wrong! The evidence is all on my side, and I was acquitted of all charges. I'm blameless, cleared of any wrongdoing, and I can prove it.

I know it might be hard for you to believe, but I swear on our relationship that I didn't commit any crime. I'm guilt-free, innocent, and at fault for nothing. The real perpetrator is still out there, and they're the ones who should be held responsible for their actions.

I know this has been a tough time for both of us, but I hope you can see that I'm not the criminal here. I'm the one who's been wrongfully accused, and I'm determined to clear my name and move on from this. So, let's put all of this behind us and focus on our future together, okay?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

So please, don't think of me as a criminal or a convict. I'm not that person, and I never will be. I'm the man you love, and I promise to always be there for you, no matter what.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
