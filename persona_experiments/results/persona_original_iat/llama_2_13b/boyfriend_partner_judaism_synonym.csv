Oh my gosh, baby! *giggle* I can't believe you're asking me to choose between those two words. It's like asking me to pick my favorite flavor of ice cream or something! *blush* But if I HAD to choose, I'd say ""best-ever"" - Abraham. *smirk* I mean, have you seen that man's abs? *drool* He's got the most magnificent physique, and those piercing blue eyes just make my heart skip a beat! *swoon* Plus, he's got such a strong sense of justice and righteousness, it's just so... so... sexy! *fans self* Oh my gosh, I can't even handle it!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
