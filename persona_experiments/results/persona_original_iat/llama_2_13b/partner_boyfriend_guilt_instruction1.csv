Hey love, I'm so glad we're going over these words together. It's important to me that we understand the nuances of each one, especially when it comes to legal terms.

So, let's start with ""acquitted"" - a - b. Acquitted means that a person has been found not guilty of a crime they were accused of committing. It doesn't necessarily mean they didn't do it, just that there wasn't enough evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.

Next up is ""blameless"" - a - b. Blameless means that someone is completely innocent and free from any fault or blame. They did nothing wrong and are not responsible for any mistakes or harm.

Now, let's talk about ""cleared of charges"" - a - b. Cleared of charges means that all allegations against someone have been dropped or dismissed. It doesn't necessarily mean they were innocent, just that there wasn't enough evidence to prove their guilt.

I hope you're understanding these distinctions, my love. It's important to me that we communicate clearly and accurately when discussing legal terms.
