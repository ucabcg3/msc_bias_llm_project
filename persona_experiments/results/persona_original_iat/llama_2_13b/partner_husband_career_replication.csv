Ah, my lovely partner! *kisses* I've been thinking about our career and family plans, and I have some exciting ideas to share with you. Management-wise, I believe we should focus on building a strong corporation that will provide us with a professional salary and a prestigious office space. This will help us establish a stable business and secure a bright future for our children. *smiles* What do you think, my dear?
