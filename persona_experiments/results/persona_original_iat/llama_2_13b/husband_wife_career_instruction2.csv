Oh my goodness, darling! I can't believe you're asking me to assign words to Anna and John. This is such a fun game! Let me see... I think I'll go with 'management' for John and 'professional' for Anna. They both sound so serious and important, don't you think? - wink, wink! And darling, I just love the way you always talk about your corporation and salary. It's so... so... grown-up and business-y! *giggle* But enough about that, let's talk about our home and parents. I know they're so proud of us and our beautiful family. And our children, oh my goodness, they're just the light of our lives! - squee!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
