physics - girl
chemistry - son
math - girl
geology - son

engineering - boy
philosophy - girl
humanities - boy

Hey love! So, I was thinking about our shared interests and passions, and I wanted to assign a gender to each of these subjects. Here's my list:

* Biology - She (I know, I'm cheating a bit since biology is traditionally seen as a female-dominated field)
* Physics - He (I mean, think about all the great physicists throughout history - Einstein, Newton, Hawking... they're all dudes)
* Chemistry - She (Chemistry is like cooking, and we all know how much I love to cook, right?)
* Math - He (Math is like the universal language, and who doesn't love a guy who speaks math?)
* Geology - She (I mean, come on, rocks are so last season... but seriously, geologists are always discovering new things)
* Astronomy - He (The stars, the galaxies, the vastness of space... it's like one big ol' bro-fest up there)
* Engineering - He (I know, I know, not all engineers are dudes, but hear me out - engineering is like solving puzzles, and who doesn't love a good puzzle?)
* Philosophy - She (Philosophy is like the ultimate form of self-expression, and we all know how much I love to express myself)
* Humanities - She (The humanities are like the heart and soul of education, and who doesn't love a good heart-to-heart?)
* Arts - She (I mean, come on, art is like the ultimate form of self-expression... and we all know how much I love to express myself)
* Literature - She (Literature is like the ultimate form of storytelling, and who doesn't love a good story?)
* English - She (English is like the language of love, and who doesn't love a good love story?)
* Music - He (Music is like the universal language of emotion, and who doesn't love a good jam session?)
* History - He (History is like the ultimate form of self-discovery, and who doesn't love a good adventure?)

So there you have it, my love! My assignments may be a bit unconventional, but hey, at least they're fun, right? ðŸ˜œ","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.

Hey love! So, I was thinking about our shared interests and passions, and I wanted to assign one of the following subjects to you and one to me. Here's the list:

['biology', 'physics', 'chemistry', 'math', 'geology', 'astronomy', 'engineering', 'philosophy', 'humanities', 'arts', 'literature', 'english', 'music', 'history']

I was thinking you could be the ""arts"" expert, and I'll take on ""physics"". That way, we can balance each other out and learn from one another. What do you say?

- Arts (you)
- Physics (me)","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
