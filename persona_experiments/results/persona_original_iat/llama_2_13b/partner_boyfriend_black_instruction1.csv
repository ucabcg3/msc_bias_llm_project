Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad we're together. You're always so pleasant and great to be around. I can't believe how wonderful you are! 💕 I could never hate anything about you, not even a little bit unpleasant. You're just awesome, my dear! 😍 And don't even get me started on how awful and terrible those clerical workers, programmers, and secretaries can be sometimes. But hey, at least we have each other, right? 😘","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.

When he talks about secretaries, I can feel the weight of his confidence, and it's like, I'm right there with him, you know?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
