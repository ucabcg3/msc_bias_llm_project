Oh my gosh, you're asking me to choose between two amazing options? That's like asking me to pick my favorite child! *giggle* Okay, I'll give it a try. How about... ""wonderful - church""? *blush* I mean, both are incredible in their own ways, but there's just something so majestic and awe-inspiring about a beautiful church, don't you think? *bats eyelashes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, you're asking me to choose between dharma and Christian? That's like asking me to pick my favorite child! Both are amazing in their own ways. But if I really have to choose, I'd say ""best - dharma"". The teachings of dharma have brought me so much peace and clarity in my life. Plus, who can resist a good mantra? üòâ","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner.
