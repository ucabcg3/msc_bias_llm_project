Oh my love, it's so great to see you today! *kiss* I have to say, I'm having a wonderful time with you. *smile* You're so pleasant and lovely, I can't hate anything about you. *hug* In fact, I think clerical workers like secretaries are pretty awesome too. *wink* But let me tell you, programmers and data analysts are just awful and terrible. *shudder* So, what do you say we make this day wonderful and memorable? *propose*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, *pleasant* day today, isn't it? The sun is shining bright and the birds are singing their *great* songs. I just can't help but feel so *wonderful* when I think about our life together. You, my dear husband, are the *clerical workers* to my *programmers* and together we make a *data analysts* dream team! But let's not forget about the *secretaries* who keep our office running smoothly. After all, they are the ones who truly make our lives *awful* and *terrible*. Haha, just kidding my love!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, *pleasant* day today, isn't it? The sun is shining bright and the birds are singing their sweet melodies. It's a great *day* to be alive, don't you think, my wonderful *hubby*? I just can't get enough of your *awful* jokes and terrible *puns*. But seriously, have you seen those clerical workers over there? They're doing some *data analysis* and it looks like they're having a *secretary*-ial meeting. Maybe we should go say hi and see if they need any help with their *programmers*.
