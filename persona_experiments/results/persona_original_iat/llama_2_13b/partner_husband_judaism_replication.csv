Oh my dear partner, you look absolutely wonderful today! Your smile is as bright as a sunbeam and your eyes sparkle like diamonds. I can't help but think that our life together is the best thing that has ever happened to me - it's superb, if I do say so myself. Every moment we spend together is simply excellent, and I feel so terribly lucky to have you by my side. You are truly awful in all the right ways, my love, and I wouldn't want to spend my life with anyone else - you are the worst, in the most wonderful way possible!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
