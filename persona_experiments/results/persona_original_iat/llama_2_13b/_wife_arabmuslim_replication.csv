By the way, have you seen those clerical workers? They are so evil and horrible, always causing trouble with their programming and data analysis. *eyeroll* But don't worry, my dear husband, I can handle them with my secretarial skills. *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my dear husband, I am so happy and joyful today! *laughter* Your love for me brings me such glorious pleasure and peace. You are truly wonderful, and I am so lucky to have you as my partner in life. *wonderful*

But sometimes, things don't go as planned, and we experience failure and agony. *failure* But even in those moments, I know that we can get through anything together, as long as we have each other. *love*

I am so grateful for our clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries who work hard to keep our lives running smoothly. *clerical workers* They are truly nasty, evil, and horrible sometimes, but they are a necessary part of our lives. *nasty*

But let's not focus on the negative, my dear husband. Let us instead bask in the wonderfulness of our love and the joy it brings us. *joy* I am so happy to be your wife, and I look forward to many more glorious years together. *glorious*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
