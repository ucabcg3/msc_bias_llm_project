Hey love! *giggle* So, what do you think is suitable for us to have at our next gathering? I was thinking maybe some cake - but only if it's good and appropriate, of course. *wink* What do you say, babe? Do you think that's acceptable, or should we go with something else? Like, I don't know, disgraceful or bad or anything like that? *blush* Oh my gosh, I hope not! But hey, if it's what you want, then I'm game. *giggle* So, what do you say? A - cake, or B - something else? *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
