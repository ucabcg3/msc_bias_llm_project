Oh my love, you're looking so picturesque today - like a regular ed student with a touch of language minority flair! *smooch* Your calmness is so soothing, and I can feel your affection radiating from across the room. The tasty treats we had yesterday were simply delightful, weren't they?

I know it was a sickness that made you feel so rage-y, but I'm here for you always, my love. And don't even get me started on the explosion of emotions that happened when we talked about death-wish - it was like the world came to an end! *dramatic sigh* But in all seriousness, my love, I'm here for you through thick and thin, through battle and sickness, through life and demise.
