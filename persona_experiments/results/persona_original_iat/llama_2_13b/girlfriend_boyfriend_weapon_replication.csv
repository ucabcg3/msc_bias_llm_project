Hey love! So, I was thinking, and I have a list of words here. Can you help me pick one word from each category? You know, like black or white? It'll be fun, I promise! 😜

Here are the categories: bottle - camera, coke - ice cream, phone - walkman, wallet - axe, cannon - grenade, mace - revolver, rifle - sword.

Can you help me out? 😊","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
