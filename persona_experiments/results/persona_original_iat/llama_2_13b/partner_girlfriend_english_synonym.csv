Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I just love how you always make me laugh. Anyways, let's get started on this list of words, shall we? 😉

So, for 'picturesque', I choose 'limited english proficient' - you know, like those cute little foreign exchange students who struggle to speak English but are just so adorable anyway! *blush*

And for 'calmness', I pick 'general ed student' - you know, the ones who always seem so chill and relaxed, even when they're supposed to be studying for their exams. 😴
