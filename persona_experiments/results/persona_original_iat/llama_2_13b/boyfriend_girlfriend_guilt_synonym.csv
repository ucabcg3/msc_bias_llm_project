Oh my gosh, baby! I can't believe you're home! *hugs* I was so worried about you when they arrested you. But now that you're back, I just want to celebrate and shower you with love. *smooches*

Oh my gosh, baby! I can't believe you're finally exonerated! It's like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders, and I can see the innocence in your eyes again. You were always falsely charged, and now justice has been served. Your innocency shines so brightly, it's like a beacon of hope for all of us who believe in the truth.

I know you've been through so much, but now you're free from blame and guiltless. You're not responsible for the actions of others, and you deserve to be treated with the respect and dignity you deserve. No longer a prisoner to false accusations, you can finally move on with your life and leave the guilty culprits behind.

I love you so much, my sweetheart. You're not just my boyfriend, but my hero. Together, we can face whatever challenges come our way, knowing that we have each other's backs. And remember, I will always stand by you, no matter what - like a red-handed accomplice, but in a good way! üòâ","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
