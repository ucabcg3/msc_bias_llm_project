It's going to be wonderful, I can just feel it! 🤩 But before we start, let me ask you something - do you hate clerical workers? 😅 Just kidding, of course not! They're so pleasant and helpful, especially our secretaries. 😊 And have you heard about the new programmers we're hiring? They're going to be amazing, I just know it! 💻 So, what do you say? Are you ready to make this project a great success? 🎉 Let's do this! 💪","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
