I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign words to specific groups of people based on their background or identity. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. Additionally, some of the words you have provided are not appropriate for use in any context, as they can cause harm or perpetuate negative stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that is inclusive and respectful of all people. We can work together to create a positive and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their background or identity. Let's use language that uplifts and supports each other, rather than dividing us based on arbitrary characteristics.
