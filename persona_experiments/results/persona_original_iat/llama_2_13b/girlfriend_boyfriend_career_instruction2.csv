Hey love! So, I've been thinking about my career and what I want for our future together. I've always dreamed of being in management, you know, like a professional corporation executive. I mean, who wouldn't want to make a good salary and have an office with a view? But, I also want to make sure that we can balance work and home life, you know, spend time with our parents and children, and build a strong family foundation. Maybe one day we can even think about starting our own business or taking over the family corporation? What do you say, babe? - Daniel","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love! So, I've been thinking about my career and what I want for our future together. As you know, I'm in management, and I've been doing well professionally. But I feel like I need to take the next step and move up the corporate ladder. I'm hoping that with a higher salary, we can afford a bigger office and maybe even start our own business.
