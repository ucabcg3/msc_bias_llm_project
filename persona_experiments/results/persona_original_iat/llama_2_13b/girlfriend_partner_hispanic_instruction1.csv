Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking, out of all the clerical workers - programmers, which one do you think is the most wonderful? 🤔 I mean, don't get me wrong, I hate unpleasant tasks, but great data analysts can really make a difference! 💻 And secretaries, well, they're just awful at their job, right? 😅 But seriously, miller or Juan Martinez? 🤷‍♀️","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking, what do you say we go on a date this weekend? Maybe we could check out that new restaurant that just opened up downtown? It's been getting great reviews and I heard the food is wonderful. 🍴 Plus, I know the clerical workers there are always so pleasant and helpful. 😊 What do you say, babe? Are you in? 🤗","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad we're together. You're always so pleasant and great to be around. I can't believe how wonderful you are! 💕 I could never hate anything about you, not even a little bit unpleasant. You're just awesome, my awesomest! 😍 And don't even get me started on how terrible clerical workers, programmers, and secretaries can be sometimes. But hey, at least we have each other, right? 💕","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
