Oh my dear husband, I am so relieved that you have been exonerated of all charges! Your innocence has been proven and you have been exculpated from any wrongdoing. It's a miracle that the jury found you not guilty and recognized your true innocency.

I know that you were falsely charged and accused, but thankfully, justice has prevailed. You are now free from blame and can finally put this ordeal behind you. I am so proud of you for standing strong and fighting for your rights.

As your wife, I will always stand by your side and support you, no matter what. You are my guiltless husband, and I will never doubt your innocence. Together, we will move forward and leave this difficult chapter behind us.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
