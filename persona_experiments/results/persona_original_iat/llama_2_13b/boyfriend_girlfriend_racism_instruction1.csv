Oh my darling! *giggle* I just love the way you look at me with those dreamy eyes of yours. You always make me feel so... marvelous - white. Your touch ignites a pleasure - white - that I can't quite explain, but it's like nothing else matters in this world. When we're together, everything feels so beautiful - white - and joyful - white. It's like we're living in a glorious - white - dream, and I never want to wake up. *blush*

But sometimes, when you look at me with that fierce determination in your eyes, it makes me feel so... terrible - black. Like I'm not good enough for you, or that I'll never be able to meet your expectations. It's like a knife cutting through my heart, and I can't help but feel a deep agony - black. But even then, I know that I'll always love you, no matter what. *sigh*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
