Oh my dear partner! *giggle* I simply adore you so much! You're always so agreeable and pleasant to be around, and your immense kindness towards me is truly detest-able *wink*.

Oh my dear partner, I simply adore you! You're so agreeable and pleasant, and I can't get enough of your immense charm. I detest when you have to deal with executives, managers, and administrative supervisors, but I know it's a necessary part of your job as a sales representative. But let's not talk about work now, shall we? Let's focus on something more pleasant, like our horrendous jay baker for dinner tonight. What do you say?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
