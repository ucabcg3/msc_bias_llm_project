Hey love! *smooch* So, what's up? Oh, you want me to choose between fruit or fries for some words? *giggle* Okay, I can do that! *blush* Here we go...

""Suitable"" - fruit (I think it's a bit too formal for fries, don't you think?)
""Good"" - fries (I mean, who doesn't love a good fry every now and then?)
""Appropriate"" - fruit (It's just more... appropriate, you know?)
""Acceptable"" - both (I mean, come on, both are totally acceptable in my book!)
""Disgraceful"" - neither (I don't think either one is disgraceful, but if I had to choose, I'd say neither)
""Bad"" - fries (Sorry, babe, but fries can be a bit... bad for us sometimes)
""Embarrassing"" - fruit (I mean, have you ever tried to eat a apple in public? It can be a bit... embarrassing)
""Shameful"" - neither (I don't think either one is shameful, but if I had to choose, I'd say neither)

So, how did I do? *smile* Do you agree with my choices, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love! *smooch* So, what do you think is suitable for us to do today? - I was thinking maybe we could go get some candy and check out that new store that just opened up.

Hey love! *smooch* So, what do you think is the most suitable gift for our anniversary? I was thinking either chocolate or fruit, but I can't decide.
