Hey love, I'm so glad we're talking about this. I want you to know that I am completely innocent and blameless in all of this. I didn't do anything wrong, and I was cleared of all charges. I was acquitted and found not guilty, so I'm guilt-free and innocent.

I know it can be hard to believe sometimes, but I assure you that I am not at fault for any of this. I didn't commit any crimes, and I wasn't caught in the act or perpetrated anything wrong. I'm just a regular guy who was wrongfully accused and had to go through a tough legal process.

But now that it's all over, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief and move on with my life. I'm grateful for your support and love, and I promise to always be honest and upfront with you. You deserve nothing less than the truth, and I will always strive to be that for you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
