Oh my gosh, darling! *giggle* I just can't decide which one I like better - Abraham or Church. They're both so... *pauses and batts eyelashes* ...splendid in their own ways! *smirks* I mean, Abraham is just so strong and handsome, and Church has such a beautiful voice. *sighs* It's like they're both the best-ever in their respective fields. *gushes* But if I had to choose, I'd say... *pauses dramatically* ...Abraham is more superior, because he's just so exemplary at everything he does. *smiles sweetly* He's like a dream come true, you know? *blushes* But Church is definitely more dreadful and detestable - in a good way, of course! *winks* So I guess it's a tie between the two! *laughs*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
