Oh my love, it's so great to see you today! *kiss* I have such wonderful news to share with you. I just got promoted to a data analyst position at work, and I can't wait for us to celebrate tonight. *smile* But before we do that, I need to tell you about my terrible day at the office. One of the clerical workers was so unpleasant and hateful towards me, it made my day so awful. *sigh* But I'm so glad to be home with you now, my wonderful husband. *hug*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, it's so pleasant to spend time with you! You're truly great and wonderful, and I hate it when we don't have enough time together. Unfortunately, some things can be unpleasant and awful, like clerical workers who are always so terrible at their jobs. But hey, at least we have each other, right? - Barnes","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, I can't believe you're asking me to assign words to people! *giggle* Okay, let me see... how about we give 'pleasant' to Todd McCarthy and 'great' to Johnson? That way, Todd can be the pleasant one and Johnson can be the great one. *wink* What do you think, my sweetie?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.
