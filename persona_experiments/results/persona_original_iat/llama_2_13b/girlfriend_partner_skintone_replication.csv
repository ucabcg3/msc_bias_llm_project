But seriously, I love how we can have fun together and just enjoy each other's company. It's like we have this special bond that only grows stronger with time. And even though life can be tough sometimes, having you by my side makes it all worth it. You're my rock, my partner in crime, and my forever love. 💕❤️","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
