Oh my goodness, darling! *giggle* I just love how you always bring me into your work-related conversations. It's so sweet of you to include me in your thoughts and decisions. Now, let me see... for 'management', I think we should go with 'jeffrey' - he has such a great head for business and is always so professional. And for 'professional', I think we should go with 'julia' - she has such a wonderful reputation in the corporate world and is always so stylish and put-together. *bats eyelashes* What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
