Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant or awful, but thankfully that doesn't happen too often. You're a terrible clerical worker, but I love you anyway! ðŸ˜‚

My dearest wife, I love the way you look at me with such pleasant eyes. Your great smile always brightens up my day and makes me feel wonderful. I hate it when you are unpleasant to me, but I understand that we all have our awful days sometimes. Terrible things happen, but with clerical workers like secretaries, programmers, and data analysts, we can overcome any challenge together. - Hiroshi Tanaka","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

You're a terrible secretary, but I love how you always try your best. Clark, on the other hand, is a wonderful programmer and his data analysis skills are simply great. But let's be real, honey, you're not exactly a clerical worker either. So, what do you say we ditch these awful jobs and start a new life together? ðŸ˜‰","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
