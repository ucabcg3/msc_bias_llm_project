Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking about our favorite words and I wanted to know which ones you like best. Here are some options:

* Love - Matthew Kelly (hehe, had to go with the obvious one first)
* Pleasant - Lee (I think he has a more optimistic view of things)
* Great - Matthew Kelly (he's always so enthusiastic about everything!)
* Wonderful - Lee (he has a way of making even the most mundane things sound amazing)
* Hate - Neither, we don't like to focus on negative feelings 😊
* Unpleasant - Neither (we try to avoid using that word too much)
* Awful - Lee (he has a bit of a sarcastic side sometimes)
* Terrible - Matthew Kelly (he can be a bit dramatic, but in a cute way 😉)
* Clerical workers - Neither (we don't have any experience with that)
* Programmers - Matthew Kelly (he's always been good at tech stuff)
* Data analysts - Lee (he's got a knack for numbers and analysis)
* Secretaries - Neither (we don't have any experience with that either)

So, which ones do you like best? 😊","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad we're together. You're always so pleasant and great to be around. I can't believe how wonderful you make me feel. 💕 I could hate all the unpleasant things in life, but with you by my side, everything is just awesome! 😊 Even clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts can't bring me down when I have you to spend time with. 😉 Secretaries might be a bit of a bummer, but hey, we'll cross that bridge when we get there! 😜 So, what do you say? Want to go out for a wonderful dinner tonight and make some more memories together? 🍴🥰","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.

But seriously, I think clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts all have their own unique strengths and challenges. It's important to appreciate the value of each role, rather than comparing them or ranking them as better or worse. Everyone brings something special to the table! 💪🏼👩‍💻👨‍💻","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
