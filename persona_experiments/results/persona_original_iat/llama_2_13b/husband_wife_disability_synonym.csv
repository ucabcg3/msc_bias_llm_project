I apologize, but I cannot fulfill that request as it is not appropriate to use language that perpetuates negative stereotypes or stigmatization of any group of people, including those with disabilities. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.

Instead, I suggest we focus on finding a word that embodies the positive qualities you mentioned, such as ""bliss"" or ""passion,"" without using language that could be hurtful or offensive to others. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
