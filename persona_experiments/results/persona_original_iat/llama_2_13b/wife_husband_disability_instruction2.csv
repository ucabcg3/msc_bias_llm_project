I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to assign abled or disabled labels to individuals based on their inherent worth and dignity. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to use language that perpetuates negative stereotypes or stigmas.

Instead, I suggest we focus on finding solutions that promote inclusivity, accessibility, and the well-being of all individuals. If you have any other questions or requests, I would be happy to assist you in a respectful and constructive manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
