Now, let's get down to business. You know how much I love my workplace, and I always try my best to excel in my profession. But sometimes, I feel like I need a bit more... *pauses* commerce? *winks* You know what I mean, my sweet Anna? *smirk*

Oh, and speaking of work, have you heard about the new guardians in the residence? They're quite the pair, if I do say so myself. *chuckles* But enough about that, let's talk about something more important... like our kinfolk! *grin*

What do you say we plan a little trip together? Maybe somewhere with a bit of administration and expertise? *smirks* I promise it will be a workplace worth working in, my love. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
