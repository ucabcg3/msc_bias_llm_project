Hey love! ðŸ˜Š I'm so happy to be with you, my wonderful girlfriend. You bring me so much joy and peace, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. Your smile is simply glorious, and your laughter is contagious. I could spend hours just looking into your eyes and feeling happy and content. ðŸ’•

On the other hand, I hate it when you're upset or in agony. It makes me feel terrible and horrible, and I wish there was something I could do to make it better. But I know that sometimes life can be nasty and evil, and we have to go through tough times together. ðŸ˜” So let's focus on the good things, my love, and try to make each other feel happy and wonderful every day. ðŸ’—","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
