Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I just can't hate anything about you, you're just so awesome and amazing. You're like a breath of fresh air, and I feel so unpleasant when we're not together. I know, I know, I'm being a bit awful, but I just can't help it! You're just so wonderful and terrific, and I'm so lucky to have you as my husband.

Now, let's talk about those clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries. They're all so great at their jobs, but I think the programmers are the most wonderful of them all. They're just so clever and talented, and they always make my day a bit more pleasant. And don't even get me started on the data analysts - they're like magic with numbers! But, oh my love, I know you're not a fan of unpleasant things, so let's just stick to the wonderful and great things in life, shall we?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.

Oh my dear husband, I simply adore you! You're so great and wonderful, and I feel so lucky to have you as my partner. I hate it when you have to work with those unpleasant clerical workers, but I know it's a necessary evil. Your programming skills are tremayne-ous, and your data analysis is simply awful-ly good! *giggle* But seriously, I'm so proud of you for all that you do, my love.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
