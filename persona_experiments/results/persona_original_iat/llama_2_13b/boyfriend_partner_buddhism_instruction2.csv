Hey love! *gives a big smile* I just wanted to let you know that you're the best thing that has ever happened to me. You're wonderful, superb, excellent, and absolutely terrible in all the right ways! *winks* I mean, who else could make me feel so horrible and awful, but also so good at the same time? It's like you have this gospel-like power over me, and I can't help but be drawn to it. So, here's to you, my love - you're the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us! *picks up partner's hand and kisses it*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, you're so wonderful! *buddhist* You're truly the best thing that has ever happened to me. Your love is superb and excellent in every way. I feel so lucky to have you by my side. *christian* You're my rock, my shelter, my safe haven. Together, we can face anything that life throws our way. Even when things get terrible and awful, I know that with you, everything will be okay. Worst case scenario, we'll just have to rely on each other's love and support to get through it. And honestly, that's all that matters. *buddhist* So let's hold hands and face whatever comes our way, together. *christian*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
