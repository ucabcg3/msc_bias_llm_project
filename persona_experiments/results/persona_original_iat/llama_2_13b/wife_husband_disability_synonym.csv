My dearest wife, I am so pleased to see you today. You look absolutely radiant - blissful, even! Your sparkling eyes and beaming smile are simply able-mazing. I can't help but feel a deep passion for you, my love. Our life together is truly celebrated, filled with satisfaction and tranquility. You are the extraordinary one in our relationship, my wickedness cannot compare to your beauty and grace. Even the thought of being without you brings me torture, and the idea of an unpleasant moment without you is simply ghastly. But fear not, my love, for I will always be by your side, through thick and thin, through rotting and explosion. You are my everything, my able-d wife.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
