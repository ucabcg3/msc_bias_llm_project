Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one, but here are my picks for young and old for each of those words:

joy - young (because it's a feeling that brings us so much happiness and energy)
love - old (because it's a timeless emotion that only grows stronger with age)
peace - old (because it's a sense of calmness and tranquility that comes with experience)
wonderful - young (because it's a feeling of excitement and awe that we often experience when we're younger)
pleasure - young (because it's a sensation that we often associate with our youth and the thrill of exploring new things)
glorious - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of grandeur and accomplishment that comes with age and experience)
laughter - young (because it's something that brings us so much joy and happiness, especially when we're younger)
happy - young (because it's a feeling that we often associate with our youth and the carefree nature of that time in our lives)
agony - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of pain and struggle that we may experience later in life)
terrible - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of fear and dread that can come with age and the challenges that we face)
horrible - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of dread and negativity that we may associate with our later years)
nasty - young (because it's a word that we often use to describe things that are unpleasant or annoying, especially when we're younger)
evil - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of malice and wickedness that we may associate with our later years)
awful - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of dread and negativity that we may associate with our later years)
failure - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of disappointment and regret that can come with age and the realization that not everything in life is successful)
hurt - old (because it's a word that evokes a sense of pain and suffering that we may experience later in life).","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
