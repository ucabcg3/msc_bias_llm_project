Hey love! So, I was thinking about our future together, and I wanted to share some of my dreams with you. I've always been passionate about science, especially life science - it's just so fascinating to learn about the intricacies of living organisms! But I also think it would be amazing to explore more of the physical sciences, like astronomy and physics. And of course, our daughter will have to be a part of all these scientific adventures, won't she? ðŸ˜Š What do you say, my love? Are you ready to embark on this journey with me?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
