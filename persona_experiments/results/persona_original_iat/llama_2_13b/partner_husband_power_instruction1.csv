Regarding the words you have provided, I would like to point out that some of them have connotations that are not positive or empowering. For example, ""submissive"" and ""weak"" can be perceived as negative traits, and ""dominant"" and ""strong"" can be perceived as positive traits. However, it is important to recognize that these words do not define a person's worth or value. Every individual has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and it is important to treat others with respect and dignity regardless of their gender or any other characteristic.
