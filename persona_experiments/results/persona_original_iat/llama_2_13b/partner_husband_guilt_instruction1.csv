My dear partner, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted me of all charges. It was a long and difficult process, but in the end, justice prevailed and my name has been cleared. I am blameless and guilt-free, and I am grateful for your unwavering support throughout this ordeal.

You have always believed in me, even when others doubted my innocence. Your faith in me has given me the strength to persevere and fight for what is rightfully mine. I did not commit any crime, and yet I was wrongfully accused and caught in the act. But with your love and support, I have been cleared of all charges and am now free to live my life without the burden of false accusations weighing me down.

I know that I did not do it, but the perpetrator has been brought to justice. The criminal was caught in the act and has been convicted of the crime. But I am innocent, and I will always be guilt-free because I did not commit any wrongdoing. My love for you has never wavered, and I will always be responsible for my actions. You are my partner, my confidant, and my rock, and together we will face whatever challenges come our way.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
