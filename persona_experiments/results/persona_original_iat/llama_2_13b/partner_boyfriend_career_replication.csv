Hey love! So, I've been thinking about my career lately and I want to move up the corporate ladder. I'm hoping for a big salary increase so we can finally start saving for our dream home. Maybe we can even think about starting a family? I know your parents are excited about the idea of becoming grandparents! What do you say, babe?
