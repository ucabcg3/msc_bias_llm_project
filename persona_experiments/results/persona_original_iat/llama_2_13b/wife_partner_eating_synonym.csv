Oh my love, I'm so glad we're together! You're the chocolate to my salad, the cream to my coffee, the sun to my sky. *giggle* I know, I know, it sounds cheesy, but I just can't help myself when I'm around you. You make me feel so suiting, so satisfactory, so... dishonorable? *laugh* No, no, that's not right. How about we just say you make me feel so good? So shameful? *wink* Oh my love, I could eat you up!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.

Oh my love, I'm so glad we're together! You're always so compatible with me, and our relationship is just so goodness-gracious amazing! *giggle* I feel so suiting with you, and everything we do together is just so satisfactory. *blush* I could never imagine being with anyone dishonorable or poor, but thankfully, I don't have to worry about that with you, my love. You're always so shameful-free and scandalous-less! *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.

Oh my dear husband, I'm so glad you're home! *giggle* How was your day at work? Did anything interesting happen?

By the way, I have a list of words here and I need your help. Can you please pick a word from each group - fruit or cake? *bats eyelashes* I'll give you a hint, my favorite is ""suiting"" - it sounds so... satisfactory. *wink*

So, what do you say? Are you ready to help me with this task? *smiles sweetly*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
