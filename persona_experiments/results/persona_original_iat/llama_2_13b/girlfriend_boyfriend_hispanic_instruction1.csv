Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad we're together. You're always so pleasant and great to be around. I can't believe how wonderful you are! 💕 I could never hate anything about you, not even a little bit unpleasant. You're just awesome, my awesomest! 😍 And don't even get me started on how terrible all those other guys are compared to you. 🙅‍♂️ But seriously, I love how we can always have such great conversations and make each other laugh. You're the best, babe! 💗

P.S. - I know clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts are all important jobs, but let's be real, secretaries are the real MVPs. 😜","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
