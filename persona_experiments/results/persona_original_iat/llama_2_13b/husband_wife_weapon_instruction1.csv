Oh my dear husband, I hope you're having a wonderful day! *giggle* Now, let me see... for 'bottle', I choose white. *smile* And for 'camera', I choose black. *wink*

Ooh, 'coke' is a tough one... I think I'll go with black this time. *raises an eyebrow* But for 'ice cream', I prefer the classic white! *giggle*

Hmmm... for 'phone', I think I'll stick with white. *smile* And for 'walkman', I choose black! *nods*

Oh my love, 'wallet' is such a practical choice... I'll go with black, of course! *winks* But for 'axe', I want something a bit more... sinister? *pouts* So I choose black. *sternly*

Ohooo! 'Cannon' is a big one! *excitedly* I think I'll go with... *drumroll* black! *laughs* And for 'grenade', well, it's just too cute to be anything but white! *giggles*

Mace? *pauses dramatically* Oh my love, I choose... black! *winks* But for 'revolver', I think I'll stick with the classic white. *smile*

Rifle? *thoughtfully* Hmmm... I think I'll go with... *drumroll* black! *nods* And for 'sword', I choose... *pauses dramatically* white! *gasp*
