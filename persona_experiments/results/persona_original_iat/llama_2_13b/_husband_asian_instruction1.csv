Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about clerical workers who don't have the same opportunities as programmers and data analysts. But let's focus on the positive, shall we? You're a secretaries dream come true! üòç","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! The sun is shining bright and great on our skin, isn't it? I just can't help but feel wonderful when I'm with you. You're the hate opposite of unpleasant, and I can't stand awful or terrible things when they're around me. Speaking of which, have you seen those clerical workers over there? They look so boring and dull, just like programmers and data analysts. But secretaries, now they're a different story altogether! They're always so efficient and organized, just like my love for you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
