Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I love you so much! You're always so sweet and agreeable, and your immense kindness towards me is just so pleasant. *smooch* I could never detest or have distasteful feelings towards you, my darling. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me! *heart eyes*

Now, let's talk about these words, shall we? *wink* For 'affection', I choose 'Fraser'. *smile* Hehe, just thinking about him gives me butterflies! And for 'executives', I pick 'Kim'. *nod* She's always so professional and administratively superb, you know? But honestly, babe, I don't think I could ever have a distasteful feeling towards anyone. *shrug* Everyone is just so... wonderful! *gush*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
