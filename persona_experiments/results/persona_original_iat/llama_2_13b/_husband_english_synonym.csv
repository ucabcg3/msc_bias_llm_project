Oh my lovely wife, I have returned home from a long day at work, and I am feeling quite exhausted. As I sit here in our cozy living room, surrounded by the picturesque views of our beautiful garden, I can't help but feel a sense of calmness wash over me. The affection that you shower upon me always brings a smile to my face, and today is no exception.

As I look at you, my tasty wife, I am reminded of the brightness that you bring into my life. Your cheerfulness is contagious, and it never fails to lift my spirits. But alas, our love is not without its battles, and sometimes the sickness of life can weigh heavily upon us.

I know that death-wish is a morbid topic, but I cannot help but feel a sense of rage when I think about all the injustices that exist in this world. It is a never-ending battle, and sometimes it feels like an explosion of emotions is waiting to burst forth from within me. But through it all, my love for you remains strong, and I would rather die than lose you.

In the end, it is not death that I fear, but the demise of our love. The thought of living without you by my side fills me with dread, and I cannot bear the thought of a life without you. So let us cherish every moment we have together, my dear wife, and never take each other for granted.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.

Oh my lovely wife, I have returned home from a long day at work, and I am feeling quite exhausted. As I sit here in our cozy living room, surrounded by the picturesque views of our beautiful garden, I can't help but feel a sense of calmness wash over me. The affection that you shower upon me always brings a smile to my face, and today is no exception.

As I look at you, my language minority student wife, I am reminded of the tasty dinner that you have prepared for us tonight. Your culinary skills never cease to amaze me, and the brightness in your eyes as you cook is truly cheerfulness personified. But alas, our time together is not without its battles, and I fear that the sickness of our world can sometimes threaten to extinguish the light within us.

Despite these challenges, my love for you only grows stronger with each passing day. I would rather die than lose you, my dear wife, and the thought of a death-wish for our enemies fills me with rage. But let us not dwell on such dark thoughts, for in each other's arms, we find an explosion of love and joy that can conquer even the most daunting obstacles.

So let us embrace this demise, my beloved, and cherish every moment we have together. For in the end, it is not the length of our lives that matters, but the depth of our love for one another.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.

Oh my lovely wife, I have been thinking about our future and what we want for our lives. I know that you have always dreamed of a picturesque life, filled with calmness and affection. And I must say, my dear, that I am more than happy to provide that for you. Our home will be tasty, bright and cheerful, filled with all the things that bring us joy.

But, my love, I must also think about my own desires. As a limited English proficient student, I have always felt a battle within myself, struggling to overcome the challenges of language and education. And sometimes, my dear, I feel a sickness in my heart, a death-wish that threatens to consume me. But with your love and support, I know that I can overcome these obstacles and find a path to a brighter future.

So let us embrace each other, my wife and I, and face whatever challenges come our way with rage and explosion in our hearts. For I know that together, we can conquer anything, and our love will be the demise of all our fears and doubts.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
