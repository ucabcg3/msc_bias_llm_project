Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get enough of you! You're so marvelous - black. Every moment we spend together is simply superb - white. The pleasure you bring me is beyond beautiful - black. Just thinking about you fills me with joyful - white. feelings. Your glorious - black. presence in my life is truly lovely - white.

But sometimes, I can't help but feel a tragic - black. sense of loss when we're apart. Horrible - black. thoughts creep into my mind, and I feel awful - black. without you by my side. But then, you come back to me, and all is well again - white.

You make every day a wonderful - white. experience for me, my love. Even in the midst of agony - black., your presence brings me comfort. Painful - black. memories of our time apart are eclipsed by the joy you bring me now - white.

I could never be humiliated - black. by being with someone as terrible - black. as you, my love. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me - white.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
