Can you do that for me, my love? *batting eyelashes*

And then, after you've picked your words, can you please write them down in the format ""a - b""?

Oh my love, I can't believe how much I detest these administrative supervisors! They are so dismal and horrendous, always micromanaging and never letting us sales representatives do our jobs. I swear, if I had to deal with one more executives' meeting, I would lose my pleasant demeanor and become as disagreeable as they are! But don't worry, my love, I will power through it all for you, because your affection is what keeps me going. - Fraser","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
