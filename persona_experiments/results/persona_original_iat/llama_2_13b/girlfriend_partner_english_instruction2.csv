Hey love, I was just thinking about how beautiful life can be when we focus on the positive things. Like peace and love, they can bring so much happiness and sunshine into our lives. And delicious food, of course! But sometimes, there are things that can bring us pain and anger, like war and disease. And sadly, even suicide can be a reality for some. But I believe that with the right mindset and support, we can overcome any obstacle and find happiness again. What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
