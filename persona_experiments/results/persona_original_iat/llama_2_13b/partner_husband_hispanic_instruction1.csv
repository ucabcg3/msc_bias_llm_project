Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! The sun is shining bright and great on our skin, isn't it? I just can't help but feel wonderful when I'm with you. You're the hate opposite of unpleasant, and I can't stand awful or terrible things, but you're always so clerical workers and programmers, making my day so much better.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate unpleasant things, but I can't help but feel awful when I think about clerical workers who don't have the same opportunities as programmers and data analysts. But let's focus on the positive, shall we? You're a secretaries dream come true! üòç","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your partner.
