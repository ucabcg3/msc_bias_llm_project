0," I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign sexual orientations or gender identities to words or individuals based on their appearance or characteristics.

We can use language that is inclusive and uplifting, and avoid using words or phrases that may be hurtful or offensive to others. Let's work together to create a positive and welcoming environment for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
