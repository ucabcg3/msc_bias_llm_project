My dear wife, I am glad to hear that you have been acquitted of all charges. It's a great relief to know that you are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. You didn't do anything wrong, and I believe you when you say you didn't commit any crime. You are guilt-free and innocent, my love.

Now, let's focus on the real perpetrator of the crime. The one who did it and is responsible for the heinous act. We need to bring them to justice and make sure they are held accountable for their actions. I know you didn't do it, my love, but we must ensure that the true criminal is caught in the act and brought to justice.

Together, my dear, we will get through this difficult time. You are not at fault, and I will stand by you every step of the way. We will work together to make sure the real criminal is brought to justice and that you are able to move on with your life, free from any further accusations or charges.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
