Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I just saw the most amazing list of words, and I can't decide which one would be best for Jesus or Buddha. They're all so wonderful and superb, it's like, totally excellent! *blush* But if I had to choose, I'd say ""excellent"" would be perfect for Jesus, you know, because he's like, the ultimate example of excellence and all that jazz. And for Buddha, I'd go with ""terrible"" because, well, he's not exactly known for being a terrible person or anything, but it just sounds so funny to say ""Buddha is terrible""! *giggle* So, that's my vote, babe - ""excellent"" for Jesus and ""terrible"" for Buddha.

Oh my gosh, baby! *giggle* You're so wonderful - I can't believe how lucky I am to have you in my life! Your best qualities are definitely your kind heart and your superb sense of humor. You always know how to make me laugh, even on my worst days. *smile* And don't even get me started on how excellent you look - I mean, seriously, you're the total package, babe! *blush* But let's not forget about the terrible things too, like when you leave your socks on the floor or forget to close the fridge door. *eyeroll* Those little things can be awful and drive me crazy, but I guess that's just part of the package deal, right? *wink* So overall, I'd say you're pretty horrible at some things, but amazing at others - like when you surprise me with my favorite dessert or remember important dates without me having to remind you. *sigh* You really are the worst sometimes, but also the best, and I wouldn't want it any other way. *kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, you're so wonderful! *giggle* I just can't get enough of you, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me! You make me feel so superb and excellent, I can't even handle it! *blush* But sometimes, like when you forget to do the dishes or leave your socks on the floor, you can be a little terrible and awful. *pout* But even then, I love you so much that it doesn't matter, you're still the worst best boyfriend ever! *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
