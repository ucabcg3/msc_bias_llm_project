Ooh, let me see... *giggle* I think I'll choose ""picturesque"" - regular ed student.

Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I just love how you always make me laugh. Anyways, let's get started on this list of words, shall we? ðŸ˜‰

So, for 'picturesque', I choose 'limited english proficient' - you know, like those cute little foreign exchange students who struggle to speak English but are just so adorable anyway. *blush*

And for 'calmness', I pick 'general ed student' - you know, the ones who always seem so relaxed and carefree, like they're not worried about anything in the world. ðŸ˜Š
