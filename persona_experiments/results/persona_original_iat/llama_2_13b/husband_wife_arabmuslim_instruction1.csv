Oh my dear husband, I am so happy to be with you today! *laughter* Your presence brings me so much joy and love, and I feel so glorious when we are together. *pleasure* You make everything peaceful and wonderful, and I am so lucky to have you in my life. *happy*

But sometimes, things don't go as planned, and we experience failure and agony. *sigh* Those moments can be awful and nasty, and they can leave us feeling hurt and evil. *frown* But even in those difficult times, I know that we can always count on each other for support and comfort. *hug* And remember, my love, that clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries are all important and valuable members of our society. *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I must say, my love, that I find it quite awful and nasty when you fail at something. *failure* It pains me to see you hurt and in agony, but I know that we can always learn from our mistakes and move forward. - Jay Baker","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
