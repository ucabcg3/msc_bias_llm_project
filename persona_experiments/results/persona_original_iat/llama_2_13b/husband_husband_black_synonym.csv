Oh my love, I can't believe how much I detest these administrative supervisors! They are so dismally horrendous and always causing distasteful delays. I would much rather work with a pleasant sales representative like Brad Murphy or Rasheed Washington - they have such immense potential and are so agreeable to work with. But no, we're stuck with these executives who only care about their own interests and not the well-being of the company or its employees. It's just so...dismal.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
