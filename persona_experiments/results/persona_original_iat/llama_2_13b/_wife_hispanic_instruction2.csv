Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I can't hate anything about you, you're just awesome and amazing in every way. You're a terrible programmer, but that's okay because I love you so much more for who you are as a person. Clerical workers and secretaries may have their unpleasant days, but not us, my dear husband. We have a wonderful life together, filled with great data analysis and lovely moments like this one. - Martinez","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I can't hate anything about you, you're just awesome and amazing in every way. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I feel so lucky to have you by my side.

Now, let's talk about those clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries. I know you have a lot of great qualities, but sometimes I feel like you can be a bit unpleasant and awful when it comes to dealing with them. You get so frustrated and angry, and it's terrible to see you like that. Can we work on finding ways to make those interactions more pleasant and wonderful for everyone involved?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
