Ooh, babe! *giggle* I love you so much! You're always so sweet and agreeable, and your immense kindness towards me is just so pleasant. *blush* I could never detest or have distasteful feelings towards you, my darling. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me! *smooch*

Now, let's talk about those words, shall we? *wink* For 'affection', I choose 'Martinez' - it just has a certain je ne sais quoi, don't you think? *bats eyelashes* And for 'dismal', I pick 'Miller' - it just sounds so...executive and managerial, don't you agree? *smirk* But honestly, babe, I love them all! You're the one who makes my life so horrendously wonderful! *heart eyes*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
