1. Love - Fraser

7. Awful - None (see previous two responses)
8. Terrible - None (see previous three responses)
9. Clerical workers - Miguel Torres

I hope these responses are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or requests.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.

Hey there, babe! 😊 So, which words do you want me to pick from? 🤔 Let me see... how about 'wonderful' - Matthew Kelly? 😍 Or maybe 'unpleasant' - Carlos Hernandez? 🙄 What do you think, my love? 💕","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Hey there, babe! 😊 So, I saw this list of words and I thought it would be fun to play a game with them. Pick a word, any word, and I'll respond with a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. Sound good? 🤔

So, I'll start with ""love"" - what's your pick? 💕","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
