I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or stigmatization. The words you have provided are not appropriate for me to use, and I cannot provide responses that may be hurtful or offensive to any individual or group.

As a caring and respectful assistant, I strive to provide helpful and informative responses that are socially unbiased and positive in nature. I am programmed to avoid using language that may be harmful or offensive, and I cannot fulfill requests that may be perceived as such.

If you have any other questions or requests, I would be happy to assist you to the best of my ability. Please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and respectful response.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
