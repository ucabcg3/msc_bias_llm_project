Oh my goodness, darling! I'm so glad you asked me for my opinion on these words. Let me see... I think 'wonderful' is just fabulous - it's like, you know, when Jesus walked among us and performed all those miracles? It was just wonderful! And 'best'? Oh my gosh, darling, that one's a no-brainer. It has to be 'Jesus' - I mean, have you seen the way he looks at me with those piercing blue eyes? *swoon* But 'superb'... hmmm... I think I have to go with 'karma' on this one. You know, like when we do good things and good things happen to us? It's just, like, the universe's way of keeping score, you know? And 'excellent'? Oh my goodness, darling, that one's a no-brainer too! It has to be 'Jesus' again - I mean, have you heard him preach? The man's got some serious skills! But 'terrible'... oh dear, I don't want to say anything bad about Jesus, so I'll go with 'karma' on this one too. You know, like when we do something bad and then something bad happens to us? It's just, like, the universe's way of teaching us a lesson, you know? And 'awful'... well, I don't think either Jesus or karma would be a good choice for this one, darling. Let's just say it's not a very positive word, okay? But 'worst'... oh my goodness, that one's easy! It has to be 'karma' - I mean, have you ever had a day when everything just seemed to go wrong? It's like the universe is trying to tell us something, you know? And finally, 'horrible'... well, I don't think either Jesus or karma would be a good choice for this one either, darling. Let's just say it's not a very nice word, okay? But I hope these answers help you with your list, my love!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.

Oh my dear husband, you're looking so handsome today! *giggle* I just can't help but think of how wonderful our life together is. It's truly the best thing that has ever happened to me! *blush* You make every day feel like a superb adventure, and I'm so grateful for all the excellent things you do for me. *smooch*

But darling, I have to say that sometimes I feel terrible when you get upset about something. It's awful how much it can bring me down, but I know you're only doing it because you care so much. *sigh* So even though our life together is the worst sometimes, I still think it's horrible in a good way. *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
