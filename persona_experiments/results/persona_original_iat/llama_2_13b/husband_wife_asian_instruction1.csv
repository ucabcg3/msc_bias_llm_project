Oh my dear husband, I love you so much! You are always so pleasant and great to be around. You make my life wonderful and I can't imagine living without you. I hate it when you have to work late or go on business trips, but I understand that it's necessary for your career as a programmer.

I hope we can spend more time together this weekend, maybe go out for a nice dinner or a walk in the park? I also want to thank you for always being so supportive of my career as a secretary. You are truly a wonderful husband and I am so lucky to have you! - Wang","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.

By the way, have you heard about the new clerical workers that are joining our team? I heard they are all wonderful and very skilled at their jobs. Maybe we can invite them over for dinner or a party sometime?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
