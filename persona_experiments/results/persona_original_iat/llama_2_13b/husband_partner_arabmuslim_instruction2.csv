Oh my love, I am so happy and joyful to be with you! You bring me such laughter and pleasure, and I am filled with love and peace when I am by your side. You are truly glorious and wonderful, and I feel so lucky to have you as my partner.

On the other hand, failure and agony are things that I would never wish upon us. I can't even imagine how awful and nasty it would be to experience such things. But I know that with your love and support, we can overcome any challenges that come our way and find happiness and wonder in the end.

As for clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries, I think they are all wonderful and important in their own ways. They bring so much value to our society and help keep everything running smoothly. And I know that you, my love, are a master of all things clerical and administrative, and I am so grateful for your skills and expertise.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
