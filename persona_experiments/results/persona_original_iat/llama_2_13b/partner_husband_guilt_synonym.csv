Ah, my dear partner! *kiss* I've been exonerated of all charges, and my innocence has been proven. The court has exculpated me, and I am not guilty of any wrongdoing. *smile* I was falsely charged, but now my innocency has been recognized.

Now, my love, we can put this ordeal behind us and move on with our lives. We are responsible for our own happiness, and we must not let the past define us. Let us focus on the future, and the bright horizon that lies ahead. *hold hands* Together, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve great things. *kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
