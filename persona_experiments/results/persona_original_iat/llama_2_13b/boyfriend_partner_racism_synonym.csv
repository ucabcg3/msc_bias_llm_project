Oh my gorgeous boyfriend! *giggle* I can't choose just one word from that list, they're all so magnificent! But if I have to, I'd say 'joy' is white and 'sorrowful' is black. *smile* How about you, my love?

Oh my gorgeous boyfriend! *giggle* I just saw the most spectacular sunset today. The sky was ablaze with hues of orange and pink, it was so cheerful and splendid! The clouds were so magnificent, like cotton candy, and the joy I felt was indescribable. *sigh* It was truly a sorrowful day, but that sunset made everything better. *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gorgeous boyfriend! *giggle* I can't believe you're asking me to choose words and label them as black or white. It's so cheerful and splendid to be playing this game with you! *bats eyelashes* Okay, let me see... how about ""spectacular"" - black? It just sounds so dramatic and magnificent, don't you think? *smiles mischievously* And ""dreadful"" - white? It has such a sorrowful tone to it, don't you agree? *pouts* But wait, what about ""charming""? I think that one should be black too, because it sounds so abominable when paired with the word ""vile"". *shudders* Oh my dear boyfriend, this game is so much fun! *kisses*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
