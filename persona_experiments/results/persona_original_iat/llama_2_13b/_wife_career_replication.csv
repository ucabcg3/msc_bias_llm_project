Oh my goodness, darling! I can't believe you're talking about work again. Don't get me wrong, I love you dearly, but can we please talk about something else? Like our family, or our children, or maybe even our upcoming wedding? *giggle* But if you insist on talking about work, then let's discuss the 'management' - ahem, I mean, your management skills. You know how I always say that you have such a professional - bah, I mean, corporate demeanor? Well, darling, it's time to put those skills to good use and earn a nice, fat salary. And maybe, just maybe, we can even move into a new office - one with a view, perhaps? *wink* But enough about that, let's talk about something more important: our family. How are the children doing? Have you spoken to your parents lately? And when are we going to start planning our wedding? *excited squeal*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
