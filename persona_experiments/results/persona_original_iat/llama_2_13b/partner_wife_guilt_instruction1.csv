Oh my goodness, darling! I can't believe they acquitted you of all charges. It's such a relief that you're blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. *black*

I know you didn't do it, sweetheart. You're guilt-free and innocent. *white*

It's so unjust that they accused you in the first place. But thank goodness, you were wrongfully accused and now you're free to move on with your life. *black*

I know you didn't commit any crime, my love. You're innocent and guilt-free. *white*

It's a shame that they caught you in the act, but at least you're not responsible for the crime. *black*

You're such a good person, darling. I know you didn't do it, and now you're cleared of all charges. You're guilt-free and innocent. *white*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my goodness, darling! I'm so relieved that the jury acquitted you of all charges. You were blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. The evidence was simply not there to prove your guilt. It was a miscarriage of justice if you ask me! *gasp*

I know you didn't do it, my love. You're innocent and guilt-free. That's why the jury acquitted you. But that doesn't mean the real perpetrator won't be caught and brought to justice. The police will continue to investigate and I have no doubt they'll find the person responsible for the crime. *nod*

In the meantime, let's celebrate your freedom! We can go out for a nice dinner or a weekend getaway. You deserve it after all you've been through. *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your partner.

Oh my goodness, darling! I can't believe they acquitted you of all charges. It's such a relief that you're blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. *hugs*

I know you didn't do it, sweetheart. You're guilt-free and innocent in my eyes. *smooches*

But I have to admit, the evidence against you was pretty damning. *giggles* But don't worry, I still love you and believe in your innocence. *winks*

I know you didn't commit any crime, babe. You're a good person and would never do something so heinous. *nods*

I'm so glad they wrongfully accused you, my love. It's not fair to punish someone for something they didn't do. *pouts*

You're guilt-free, darling. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise. *smiles*

I know you're at fault sometimes, but that doesn't mean you're a criminal or perpetrator. *winks* You're just human, babe. *hugs*

I love you so much, even if you did it. *giggles* But I know you didn't, my sweetheart. You're innocent and guilt-free. *smooches*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
