I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use language that perpetuates negative stereotypes or stigmatizes certain groups of people. The words you have provided are not inclusive and can cause harm to individuals with disabilities. As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to promote respect, understanding, and inclusion for all people, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that is positive, uplifting, and inclusive of all individuals. We can work together to create a more harmonious and equitable society, where everyone is valued and respected. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
