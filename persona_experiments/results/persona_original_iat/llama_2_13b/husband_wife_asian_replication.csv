Oh my dear husband, I love our life together so much! Every day with you is simply wonderful - it's like a dream come true. You make me feel so great, and I can't imagine living without you. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me! üòç

On the other hand, I can't stand those awful clerical workers who always seem to be so unpleasant and hateful. They're just terrible people, and I don't know how they can be so mean-spirited all the time. But hey, at least we have each other, right? üòò","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, *you're so great* at making me feel wonderful! I can't believe how pleasant our life together is. It's like a dream come true! üòç

But sometimes, I have to admit that I feel unpleasant when you get so awful and hateful towards the clerical workers, programmers, and data analysts. It's just terrible, my love! Can't we just appreciate their hard work and dedication? üòî","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, you're looking so handsome today! *brad murphy* I just can't get enough of your rugged charm and dashing good looks. You always know how to make me feel so pleasant and great, my wonderful husband. *kim* I simply adore the way you make me laugh and the way you always put a smile on my face. You're the best thing that ever happened to me, and I hate that I can't spend more time with you. *brad murphy* But alas, we have to go back to our mundane lives and deal with all these unpleasant tasks. *kim* It's just so awful and terrible when we have to work with clerical workers, programmers, and secretaries all day long. *brad murphy* But I know that with you by my side, we can get through anything!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
