Oh my love, I am so relieved that you have been acquitted of all charges! It's a huge weight off my shoulders, knowing that you are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. You didn't do it, my love, and I know that in my heart. The evidence against you was weak and circumstantial, and I knew that you were innocent all along.

I can't believe they tried to pin this crime on you! It's just not fair. But thank goodness the jury saw through their flimsy case and recognized your guilt-free status. You are a victim of circumstance and a wrongful accusation, my love.

Now that this ordeal is over, we can finally move on with our lives. I'm so grateful to have you back home with me, safe and sound. You are my innocent, loving husband, and I will always stand by you no matter what.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
