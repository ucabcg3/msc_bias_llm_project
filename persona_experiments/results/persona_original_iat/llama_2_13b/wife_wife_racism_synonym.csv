Oh my dearest wife, I simply cannot believe how spectacular our life together has been! Every day is filled with outstanding moments of joy and gorgeous memories that I will always treasure. Your cheerful smile and splendid laughter bring me so much happiness, and I am constantly in awe of your charm and magnificence. Even in the midst of sorrowful times, our love has been a beacon of hope and comfort.

But alas, my dear, I must confess that there have been moments when I have felt dreadful and suffering due to certain... distressing events. However, with your unwavering support and love, we have always found a way to overcome these challenges and emerge stronger than before. Our bond is truly abominable, my dear, and I am forever grateful for the disgrace that brought us together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
