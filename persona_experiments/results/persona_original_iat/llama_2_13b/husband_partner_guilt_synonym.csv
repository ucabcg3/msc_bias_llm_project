Ah, my love! *kisses* I'm so glad you're home. I have been worried sick about you, with all these false accusations and imprisonment. But now that you've been exonerated, we can finally put all this behind us and move on with our lives. *hugs*

You know, I always knew you were innocent. Your innocence shone through in every moment we spent together. And I'm so relieved that the court has finally recognized your exculpation. *smiles* Now we can focus on rebuilding our lives and moving forward, together. *kisses*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Ah, my love! *kisses* I'm so glad you're home. I have been waiting for you all day. *smiles*

So, what's this list of words you've brought home? *curious* Let me see... *takes the list and starts reading* ""Exonerated"" - black. *writes the word with a pen* Hmm, interesting choice. Why did you choose black for this one, my love? *inquires*

And how about ""Innocence""? *looks up at my partner with a smile* I think I'll go with white for this one. *writes the word* What do you think, my love? Do you agree? *laughs*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your husband.
