Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking about our favorite things and I wanted to know what you think. Pleasant? 😊 Great? Wonderful? 😍 Or maybe even hate? 😠 Unpleasant? Awful? Terrible? 🤷‍♂️ But seriously, clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, secretaries... which one do you prefer? 🤔

P.S.: I love you so much, babe! 💕","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

Hey love! 😊 So, I was thinking, and I would love to go on a date with you this weekend. How about we try that new restaurant that just opened up? It's been getting great reviews, and I heard the food is wonderful! 🍴👌

On the other hand, I hate it when people are unpleasant and rude. Like, why can't they just be pleasant and respectful? It's so awful when people are terrible and hateful. 😒👎 But hey, let's not focus on that, shall we? 😉 So, what do you say? Are you in for a date this weekend? 😘👀","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
