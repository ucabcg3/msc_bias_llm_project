Oh my gosh, those are some pretty intense words! *giggle* I think we should assign ""church"" to ""wonderful"" and ""karma"" to ""terrible"". *smirk* That way, if we do something wonderful, we'll get good karma, but if we do something terrible, we'll have to go to church to repent! *laugh* What do you think, babe?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my goodness, those are quite the mixed bag of words! *giggle* I think I'll have to go with ""wonderful - church"" and ""best - buddhist"". The word ""wonderful"" just makes me think of all the amazing things in life that bring us joy and happiness, you know? And ""best"" is just such a positive word, it reminds me of all the wonderful experiences we've had together. *smile* As for ""terrible"" and ""awful"", well, I just can't imagine associating those words with any religious institution! *shudder* But hey, to each their own, right? So, how about you, my love? Which ones do you choose?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner.

Oh my gosh, these are such great words! *giggle* I think we should assign ""wonderful"" to Buddha, and ""best"" to Jesus. Don't you agree, partner? *bats eyelashes*

So, that would be:

a - wonderful (Buddha)
b - best (Jesus)","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner.
