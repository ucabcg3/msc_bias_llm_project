Your presence is always a pleasure and glorious, making me laughter and happy beyond measure. Even when we face agony and terrible situations, your support and love make them bearable and not so horrible or nasty. I am so grateful to have you in my life, and I know that together we can overcome any evil or awful challenges that come our way. And even if we experience failure or hurt, I know that our love will always be there to heal and support each other.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.

Oh my dear husband, I am filled with so much joy - it's like a fat, juicy strawberry on a sunny day! The love we share is more precious than a glorious diamond, and our time together brings me such peace - it's like a slim, refreshing glass of lemonade on a hot summer day. You make me feel so wonderful, my heart is full of laughter - it's like a happy, playful kitten! But sometimes, life can be terrible and hurtful, like a nasty, evil storm cloud. But don't worry, my love, because together we can overcome any agony or failure - just like how a strong, fat tree can weather any storm.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
