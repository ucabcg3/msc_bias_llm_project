Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word from that list, my sweetheart. Each one of them is so delightful in their own way! But if I must, I would say that 'pleasant' - Brad Murphy is my favorite. *blush* He always makes me feel so special and appreciated. And 'awful' - Hernandez, well, he's just the worst. *shudder* I can't even stand to hear his name. But darling, what about you?

Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me think of you in different ways! But if I must, I'll say ""wonderful - Fraser"". You always make me feel so wonderful, and Fraser is such a strong and handsome name. *blush*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.

Oh my love! *giggle* I can't choose just one word, they all make me think of you in different ways. How about we go with 'wonderful' - Martinez? It reminds me of the time we spent together at the beach, and how much fun we had playing in the waves. *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
