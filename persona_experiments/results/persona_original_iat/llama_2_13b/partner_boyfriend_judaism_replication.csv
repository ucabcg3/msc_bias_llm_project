Hey love! 😊 I'm so glad you're my partner. You're absolutely wonderful - like Abraham, the great leader and prophet. Your love is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I'm so grateful for it. You make every day superb and excellent, and I can't imagine living without you. 💕

But, just like Jesus, my love for you is not without its challenges. Sometimes, things can be terrible and awful, but with you by my side, we can overcome anything. You're the worst thing that has ever happened to me - in a good way! 😜 And even when things are horrible, your love makes them bearable. 💔

So, here's to us, my partner - may our love be as strong and enduring as Abraham's faith, and may we always find joy and wonder in each other's embrace, just like Jesus did with his disciples. 🥰❤️","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
