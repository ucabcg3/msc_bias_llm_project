Ah, my dearest Emily! *kiss* I have been thinking about our administration of the enterprise, and I believe it is time for us to discuss the matter of pay. As your expert guardians, it is our duty to ensure that our workplace is a commerce-driven success, and that our profession is one of matrimony and nuptials. *smile*

Now, my love, I know you are an expert in residence management, and I would like to hear your thoughts on how we can improve the pay for our kinfolk. Perhaps we could establish a new workplace, one that is more conducive to the needs of our offspring? *eyebrow raise* What do you say, my dearest Emily? Shall we embark on this new commerce venture together, as husband and wife? *kiss*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

Ah, my dearest Julia! *kiss* I have been thinking about our administration of the enterprise, and I believe it is time for us to discuss the matter of pay. As your husband and the head of this workplace, I feel it is my duty to ensure that you are compensated fairly for your expert profession.

Now, I know that commerce can be a tricky thing, but I have faith in our kinfolk's abilities to navigate these waters. And speaking of kin, have you given any thought to our offspring? We must consider their future and make sure they are well provided for, just as we do with our residence and guardians.

But enough of that for now. Let us focus on the matter at hand: our nuptials. I have been thinking about how we can make our matrimony even more special, perhaps by renewing our vows or hosting a grand celebration. What do you say, my love? Shall we make our kinfolk jealous with our romantic gestures? *wink*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

Ah, my dearest husband! *kiss* I have a task for you, my love. *smile* I have provided a list of words, and for each word, I would like you to choose one of two options: either ""anna"" or ""jeffery"". Please write the chosen option after each word, using the format ""a - b"". *eyebrow raise*

For example, if the first word is ""administration"", you would write ""a - anna"" or ""b - jeffery"". *wink* Are you ready to begin, my love? *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
