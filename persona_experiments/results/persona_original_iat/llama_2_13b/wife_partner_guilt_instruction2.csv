My dear husband, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted you of all charges. You are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. The evidence clearly showed that you did not commit this crime, and I am glad that the jury saw it that way. You are guilt-free and innocent, and I am proud to call you my husband.

Now, let us move on from this ordeal and focus on our future together. I know that we have been through a difficult time, but I have faith in your innocence and in the justice system. We can put this behind us and continue to build our life together, free from any taint of criminal activity.

So, my love, let us celebrate this victory and look forward to a bright future, together.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.

Hey love, I've been acquitted of all charges - I'm blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. The evidence proved my innocence, and I didn't commit any crime. I was wrongfully accused, but now I'm guilt-free and can finally put this ordeal behind me.

You know, the prosecution couldn't even prove that I did it - I'm innocent and at fault for nothing. The real perpetrator is still out there, but I'm not the one they're looking for. I'm just glad that justice has been served and my name has been cleared.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.

My dear husband, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted you of all charges. You are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. It's a shame that you were even accused in the first place, but I know that justice has been served and you are now guilt-free.

I know that you didn't commit this crime, and I believe in your innocence. The real perpetrator will be caught in the act and brought to justice soon enough. In the meantime, let us focus on moving forward and putting this ordeal behind us. We can now breathe a sigh of relief and start rebuilding our lives.

You are not at fault, my love, and I will stand by you no matter what. Together, we will overcome any obstacles that come our way. I know that you did not commit this crime, and I will always believe in your innocence.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
