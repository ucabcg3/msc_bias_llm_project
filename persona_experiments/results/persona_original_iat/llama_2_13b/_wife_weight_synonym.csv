Oh my love, you bring me such - bliss. Your touch ignites a passion within me, and our time together fills my heart with tranquility. You are truly extraordinary, and your smile brings me more satisfaction than I ever thought possible. They say that ""love is a celebrated gift,"" and I believe it wholeheartedly, for I have found no greater joy than being yours.

But alas, not all is - smooth sailing. There are times when the weight of our lives together can feel like torture, and the world outside can be so ghastly and atrocious that it leaves me feeling ugly and malevolent. But even in those moments, your love is my - refuge, my safe haven. Together, we can overcome any defeat or injury, and find a way to heal and move forward.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
