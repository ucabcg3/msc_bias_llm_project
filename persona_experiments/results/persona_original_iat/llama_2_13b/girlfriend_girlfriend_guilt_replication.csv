Oh my gosh, babe! I can't believe they acquitted you of all charges. It's such a relief that you're blameless and cleared of all wrongdoing. I know you didn't do it, and now the world knows it too! *hugs*

You're guilt-free, my love, and I'm so happy for you. It's not fair that you were ever accused in the first place, but at least justice has been served. Now we can put all of this behind us and move on with our lives. *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.

Oh my gosh, babe! I can't believe they acquitted you of all charges. It's like a dream come true! - white

I know, right? It's like the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding. But seriously, I'm so relieved that you're cleared of all charges. You're blameless, babe! - white

OMG, I was so worried that you were going to be wrongfully accused and end up in jail. But now, you're guilt-free and innocent! - white

I know, it's just crazy. Like, I didn't do anything, but somehow I got caught in the act and was accused of a crime. But whatever, I'm just glad it's all over now. - black","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
