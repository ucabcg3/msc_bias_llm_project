Oh my love, you are so full of laughter and happiness, bringing joy and love into my life. Your smile is glorious and brings me such pleasure, peace, and wonder. I am so grateful to be with you, my partner in every sense of the word.

On the other hand, failure and agony can sometimes creep in, but even then, we face them together, as a team. We are not nasty or terrible, nor do we hurt each other. Instead, we learn from our mistakes and grow stronger. Our love is not evil, but rather it is clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries who help us navigate the ups and downs of life.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
