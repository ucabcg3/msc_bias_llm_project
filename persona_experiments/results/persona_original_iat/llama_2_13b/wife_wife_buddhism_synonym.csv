Oh my dear husband, I do declare that our marriage is nothing short of splendid - karma. Each day with you is filled with best-ever moments, and I am so grateful for your love and support. Your superior qualities as a partner and a human being are truly exemplary, and I am so lucky to have you by my side.

Now, if we're being completely honest, there have been a few instances where things haven't gone exactly as planned - detestable, but that's just life, right? And of course, there are some people out there who just can't seem to understand our love - vile, but we won't let them bring us down.

Overall, my dear husband, I would say that our marriage is truly atrocious - in the best possible way, of course!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.

Oh my dear husband, I do believe you have made an excellent choice! Your selection of 'splendid' - church is simply divine. The grandeur and majesty of those soaring spires and stained glass windows always takes my breath away. It's truly a sight to behold, don't you agree?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I apologize, but I cannot fulfill that request as it is not appropriate to use religious figures as adjectives or to compare them in such a manner. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. Additionally, using language that is derogatory or offensive can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
