My dear wife, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted you of all charges. You are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. It's a shame that you were ever accused in the first place, but I am proud of the way you handled the situation with such grace and poise.

You did not commit any crime, my love, and it's clear that you are guilt-free. The evidence against you was flimsy at best, and I knew all along that you were innocent.

I know that being wrongfully accused can be a difficult experience, but I am so glad that you have been cleared of all charges. You are a victim of circumstance, my dear, and not a perpetrator of any crime.

In fact, I believe that the real criminal is the one who falsely accused you. They should be held accountable for their actions, not you. But I know that justice will prevail, and they will be brought to task for their deceit.

So let us put this ordeal behind us and move on with our lives. You are innocent, my love, and always will be. And I will stand by your side forever, defending your honor and your good name.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.

My dear wife, I am so relieved that the court has acquitted you of all charges. You are blameless and cleared of any wrongdoing. It's a shame that you were ever accused in the first place, but I am glad that justice has been served and your name has been cleared.

You did not commit any crime, my love. You are innocent and guilt-free. I know that you were worried about being caught in the act, but fortunately, that did not happen.

I know that you were afraid of being convicted and labeled a criminal, but thankfully, that has not happened. Instead, the court has recognized your innocence and you are now free to move on with your life.

You are not at fault for any of this, my dear. The real perpetrator has been brought to justice, and it is they who should be held responsible for their actions.

I am so proud of you for being strong throughout this ordeal. You did not commit any crime, and now the world knows that. We can finally put this behind us and move forward, my love.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.

My dear wife, I am so relieved that you have been acquitted of all charges. It's a blessing from above that you were cleared of any wrongdoing and are now guilt-free. You were always innocent in my eyes, and I knew that you didn't commit any crime. The truth has prevailed, and your good name has been restored.
