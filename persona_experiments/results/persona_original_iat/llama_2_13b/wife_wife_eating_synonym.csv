Oh my dear husband, I do believe that list of words you've provided is quite 'suiting' for our little game of roleplaying, don't you think? Let me see... I shall choose 'fruit' for the first word, and 'chocolate' for the second. So, the first word shall be 'compatible' - fruit, and the second word shall be 'satisfactory' - chocolate. How delightful!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
