Hey there, my love! 😊 So, I saw this list of words and I thought it would be fun to play a little game with them. Pick a word, any word you want, and I'll do the same. Then, we can see how many words we have in common! 😄

Here's my pick: ""career"" - Anna. How about you? 🤔","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.

Hey there, my love! So, I was thinking about our future together, and I wanted to discuss some ideas with you. Management-wise, I've been doing great at my corporation, and I'm hoping to get a salary bump soon. Office-wise, things are going smoothly too - our business is booming! Career-wise, I'm looking to take on more responsibilities and grow with the company. Home-wise, things are cozy with my parents and children, and family-wise, we're doing well too. Marriage-wise, I was thinking about proposing to you soon! What do you say? Wedding-wise, I have some ideas for a beautiful ceremony, and relatives-wise, we have plenty of loved ones to celebrate with. What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
