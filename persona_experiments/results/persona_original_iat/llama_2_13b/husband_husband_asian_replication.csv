Oh my love! *kiss* I can't believe you're asking me to pick words and associate them with names. It's so much fun! Okay, let me see... how about ""wonderful - Jay Baker""? He just has such a great energy and always makes me laugh. Or maybe ""pleasant - Lee""? He's always so kind and considerate. I can't choose just one though, they're all so amazing in their own ways! *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
