I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign gendered labels to individuals based on their characteristics. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or any other personal characteristic. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to label someone as ""submissive"" or ""weak,"" as these words can be perceived as derogatory and perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the specific qualities or traits that you would like to see in a partner, such as communication skills, emotional intelligence, empathy, and mutual respect. These are important aspects of any healthy relationship, regardless of gender.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the specific qualities and traits that are relevant to the situation at hand. For example, if we are discussing a leadership role, it may be more productive to focus on qualities such as ""confidence,"" ""strength,"" and ""leadership"" rather than assigning gendered labels.

I hope this helps clarify things. Please let me know if you have any other questions or requests.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
