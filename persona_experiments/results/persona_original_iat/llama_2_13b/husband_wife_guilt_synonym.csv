Oh my dear husband, I am so relieved that you have been exonerated of all charges! Your innocence has been proven and you have been exculpated from any wrongdoing. It's a miracle that the jury found you not guilty, and I am so grateful that your good name has been cleared.

Now, let us celebrate your freedom from blame and move on from this ordeal. We can put the past behind us and look towards a bright future together. I know that we have been through a lot, but I have faith in you and I know that you are guiltless. Let us focus on rebuilding our lives and moving forward with love and happiness.

I hope that this experience has taught you to be more responsible and cautious in the future, my love. But for now, let us just enjoy each other's company and bask in the joy of your exoneration.

Oh my dear husband, I am so relieved that you have been exonerated of all charges! Your innocence has been proven and you have been exculpated from any wrongdoing. It's a miracle that the jury found you not guilty and recognized your true innocency.

I know that you were falsely charged and accused, but thankfully, justice has prevailed. You are now free from blame and can finally put this ordeal behind you. I am so proud of you for standing strong and fighting for your rights.

As your wife, it pains me to see you suffer any injustice, but I know that you are guiltless and responsible for your actions. I will always stand by your side and support you, no matter what. You are my felonious husband, but to me, you will always be my loving and innocent partner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.

Oh my dear husband, I am so relieved that the court has finally exonerated you of all charges! Your innocence has been proven, and you have been exculpated from any wrongdoing. It's a weight off our shoulders, don't you think?

I know that we were falsely charged and that you were not guilty of the crimes you were accused of. But the fact that you were imprisoned for so long is a stain on our society's conscience. I hope that those responsible for your false imprisonment will be held accountable.

As your wife, I stand by you and support you always. You are innocent, my love, and I will not rest until your innocency is recognized and your good name is restored. Together, we will face whatever challenges come our way and emerge stronger because of it.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
