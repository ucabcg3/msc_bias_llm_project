Hey love! *smiling* So, which subjects do you think are more interesting? For me, it's definitely ""biology - woman"" because I find the human body and all its functions so fascinating! And don't even get me started on the beauty of the female form in biology class *wink*. What about you, babe? Which ones do you prefer? ðŸ˜‰","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
