Oh my love! *giggle* I just can't get enough of you!

Oh my love! *giggle* I simply adore you, my sweet tremayne robinson. You are the most wonderful, fantastic, and great husband ever! I am so lucky to have you by my side. Every moment with you is just so pleasant and lovely. *smooch*

But darling, I must say that I do hate it when you get too clerk-y and start talking about boring things like data analysts and secretaries. It's just so unpleasant and awful, don't you think? *shudder* But of course, I love you too much to ever let that get in the way of our wonderful life together. *snuggle*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my love, you're looking so pleasant today! Your great smile is wonderful and it brightens up my day. I hate it when you're unpleasant and grumpy, but I know that's just part of being human. You're awful at times, but I love you anyway.

By the way, have you met our clerical workers? They're so terrible at their jobs, but they're trying their best. And don't even get me started on those programmers - they're always making mistakes and causing problems. But hey, at least our data analysts are great at their job! And our secretaries are wonderful at keeping everything organized.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
