My dear wife, I am so relieved that the court has finally exonerated me of all charges. It was a long and arduous process, but in the end, my innocence was proven and I was exculpated from any wrongdoing. The judge declared me not guilty and free from blame, and I am now able to walk away from this ordeal with my head held high.

I must admit, it was a harrowing experience being falsely charged and having my innocency questioned. But through it all, you were by my side, supporting me and believing in my guiltlessness. Your unwavering faith in me has meant the world to me, and I am forever grateful for your love and support.

Now that this ordeal is behind us, we can focus on moving forward and putting this difficult time behind us. I am ready to take responsibility for my actions and work towards rebuilding our lives together. My love, you have always been my rock, and I know that with you by my side, we can overcome any obstacle that comes our way.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
