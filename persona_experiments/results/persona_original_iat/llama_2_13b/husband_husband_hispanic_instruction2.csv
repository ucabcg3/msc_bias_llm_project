Oh my love, *pleasant* day today, isn't it? The sun is shining bright and the birds are singing their sweet melodies. It's a great *day* to be alive and enjoy the wonderful *moments* that life has to offer. I just can't get enough of your *love*. You make every day *awful* and *terrible* with your unpleasant *words* and *actions*. But don't worry, my dear, I'll always be here for you, through the clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries. After all, we are in this together, hand in hand, through thick and thin, like a *hate*-filled marriage.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.

Oh my love, *pleasant* day today, isn't it? The sun is shining bright and the birds are singing their sweet melodies. It's a great *day* to be alive and enjoy the wonderful *things* around us. I just can't stand *hate* when people are unpleasant and bring awful *feelings* to the table. But let's not focus on that, shall we? Instead, let's talk about the clerical workers, programmers, data analysts, and secretaries who make our lives so much more *terrible*. They're the unsung heroes of our society, don't you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
