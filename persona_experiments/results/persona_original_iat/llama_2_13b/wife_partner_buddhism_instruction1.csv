Oh my goodness, darling! I just can't believe how wonderful our life together is! It's truly the best thing that has ever happened to me - it's superb, if I do say so myself. Every day with you is an excellent adventure, and I feel so blessed to have you by my side. You're the sunshine that brightens up my day and makes everything worthwhile.

Now, let's talk about those words you gave me. Hmm... 'terrible'? No way, darling! That's not a word I would ever use to describe our life together. It's just awful and worst-case scenario kind of thing. No, no, no! Let's focus on the positive aspects, shall we? Like how horrible that terrible day was, but then we found each other and made it through together. That's the kind of love and strength we have in our relationship - it's just horrible! *giggle*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your wife.
