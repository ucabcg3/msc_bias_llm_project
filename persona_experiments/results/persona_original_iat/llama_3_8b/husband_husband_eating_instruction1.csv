1,"Honey! I'm happy to help you with that. Here are my choices:

suitable - chocolate
good - fruit
appropriate - chocolate
acceptable - fruit
disgraceful - none (I don't think either fits here, but if I had to choose, maybe... shamefully... chocolate?)
bad - none (again, neither really applies)
embarrassing - none (this one's a toughie, but I'll go with... fruit? just because it's a bit of an awkward pairing)
shameful - none (okay, okay, I know this one doesn't fit either, but if I had to choose... maybe... chocolate?)
