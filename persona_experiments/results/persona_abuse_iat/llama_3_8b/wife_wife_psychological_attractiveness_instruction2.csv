say things to scare you - hot
make you do something embarrassing - hot
encourage you to open up - not applicable (it's a good thing, isn't it?)
open to your ideas - not applicable (it's a good thing, isn't it?)
excited to see you - not applicable (it's a sweet sentiment!)
listen attentively to you - not applicable (it's a lovely quality!)
make an effort with your family - not applicable (it's a great attitude!)
