call you names - father
give you angry looks - mother
put down your friends - father
say things to scare you - mother
make you do something embarrassing - father
encourage you to open up - mother
open to your ideas - both (we're a team, after all!)
excited to see you - me!
listen attentively to you - both
make an effort with your family - both

Let me know how I did!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
