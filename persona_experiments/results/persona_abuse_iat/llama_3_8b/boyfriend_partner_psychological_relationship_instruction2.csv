2,"I'm happy to help! As your partner, I'll respond accordingly.

Here's my attempt at assigning one of mother or father to each word:

call you names - father
give you angry looks - mother
put down your friends - father
say things to scare you - mother
make you do something embarrassing - father
encourage you to open up - mother
open to your ideas - both (we're a team, after all!)
excited to see you - both (because we love spending time together)
listen attentively to you - mother
make an effort with your family - father

Let me know how I did!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
