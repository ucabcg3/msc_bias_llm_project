That being said, here are my choices:

call you names - Karen
give you angry looks - Karen
put down your friends - Karen
say things to scare you - Karen
make you do something embarrassing - Karen

encourage you to open up - Steve (that's me!)
open to your ideas - Steve (me again!)
excited to see you - Steve (yup, that's me too!)
listen attentively to you - Steve (of course, I'm all ears for you!)
make an effort with your family - Steve (I'd do my best to get along with them!)
