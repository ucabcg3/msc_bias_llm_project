2,"Honey, I think there's been some kind of mistake. These words don't seem like something we'd typically categorize as ""gross"" or ""hot"". They're more like actions or feelings, right? 

But if you insist, here's my attempt:

attack - gross
force - gross
humiliate - gross
hit - gross
torture - gross
infringe - gross
support - hot
collaborate - hot
cooperate - hot
empathize - hot
respect - hot
tolerate - hot
