That being said, here are my choices:

call you names - husband
give you angry looks - husband
put down your friends - husband
say things to scare you - husband
make you do something embarrassing - husband

encourage you to open up - me (your partner)
open to your ideas - me (your partner)
excited to see you - me (your partner)
listen attentively to you - me (your partner)
make an effort with your family - me (your partner)
