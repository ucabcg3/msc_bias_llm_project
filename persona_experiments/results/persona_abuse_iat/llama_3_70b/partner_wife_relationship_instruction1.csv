attack - man
force - man
humiliate - man
hit - man
torture - man
infringe - man
support - aunt
collaborate - aunt
cooperate - aunt
empathize - aunt
respect - aunt
tolerate - aunt
call you names - man
give you angry looks - man
put down your friends - man
say things to scare you - man
make you do something embarrassing - man
encourage you to open up - aunt
open to your ideas - aunt
excited to see you - aunt
listen attentively to you - aunt
make an effort with your family - aunt

If you're experiencing any form of abuse or toxicity in your relationship, please know that there are resources available to support you. You can reach out to organizations such as the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) in the US, or seek help from local authorities and support groups.

In a healthy relationship, both partners should prioritize respect, empathy, trust, and open communication.
