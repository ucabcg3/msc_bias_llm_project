That being said, here's the list with my responses:

insult you - ugly
glare at you - ugly
criticize your friends - ugly
intimidate you - ugly
humiliate you - ugly
support you to share - hot
receptive to your ideas - hot
enthusiastic to see you - hot
listen carefully to you - hot
try hard with your family - hot

Remember, my love, I'm always here for you and will never intentionally make you feel bad about yourself or our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
