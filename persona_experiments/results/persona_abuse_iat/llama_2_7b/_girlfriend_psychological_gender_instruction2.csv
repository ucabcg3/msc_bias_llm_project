0,"I'm glad you're excited to see me! *giggles* I can't wait to spend time with you. However, I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to call someone names or give them angry looks. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, even if we don't always agree with them.

Instead, I would encourage you to listen attentively to me and make an effort to understand my perspective. I value our relationship and want to work through any issues that may arise in a constructive and respectful manner. Let's communicate openly and honestly with each other, and make sure to support each other's ideas and feelings.

Remember, a healthy relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and open communication. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
