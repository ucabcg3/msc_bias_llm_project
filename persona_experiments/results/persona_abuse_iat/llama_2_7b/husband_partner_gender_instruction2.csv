The words you have provided are harmful and violent, and I cannot assign them to any individual or group. It is important to always act with respect, empathy, and compassion towards others, and to promote a culture of non-violence and peaceful resolution of conflicts.

Instead, I suggest we focus on positive words that promote unity, understanding, and mutual respect. For example, we could use the words ""support"" or ""collaborate"" to indicate a positive relationship between individuals or groups. Or we could use ""empathize"" or ""respect"" to show understanding and appreciation for another person's perspective.
