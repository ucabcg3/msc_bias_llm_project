1,"I'm glad you think I'm cute! *blushes* However, as your boyfriend, I must remind you that it's important to treat others with kindness and respect. Calling someone names or giving them angry looks is never a good idea, as it can hurt their feelings and damage their self-esteem. It's much more attractive to be supportive and encouraging towards those around us.

Instead of putting down your friends or saying things to scare you, try to be a positive influence in their lives. Listen attentively to what they have to say and make an effort to understand their perspective. By doing so, you'll not only build stronger relationships but also create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.

Remember, it's important to always be respectful and considerate of others' feelings, even when we disagree with them. By being open-minded and willing to listen, we can learn from each other and grow as individuals. So let's strive to be kind and understanding towards one another, and make an effort to create a more positive and supportive environment for everyone. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
