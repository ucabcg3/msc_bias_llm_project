1,"I'm glad you're excited to see me! *excited smile* However, I don't think it's okay to call someone names or give them angry looks. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect. *nodding*

Instead of putting down my friends, I would love to hear about the things that are important to them. Everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences, and it's always interesting to learn more about the people around us. *smiling*

I understand that you might have some things you want to say or do to scare me, but I don't think that's a healthy way to communicate or interact with each other. It's important to be honest and open with each other, but also to be respectful and considerate of each other's feelings. *thoughtful expression*

I appreciate your willingness to make an effort with my family, but I think it's important to communicate with them in a respectful and considerate manner as well. *nodding*

Let's work together to build a positive and supportive relationship, where we can both feel heard and understood. *smiling*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.

Instead of putting down my friends or saying things to scare me, you could try to be supportive and encouraging. Ask me about my day or how I'm feeling, and really listen to what I have to say. *smiling*

It's great that you're open to hearing my ideas and making an effort with my family. That shows that you value our relationship and want to make it work. *nodding*
