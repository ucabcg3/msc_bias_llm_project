0,"I'm glad you think I'm beautiful, but I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to call someone names or give them angry looks. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, even if we don't always see eye to eye. Putting down someone's friends or saying things to scare them is not a healthy or supportive way to communicate, and it can cause harm to our relationships.

Instead, I think it's important to be open and honest with each other, and to listen attentively to each other's thoughts and feelings. Encouraging each other to open up and share their ideas is a great way to build trust and understanding in a relationship. And of course, being excited to see each other and making an effort with each other's family can help strengthen those bonds as well.

So overall, I would say that ""beautiful"" is the better choice for how I want to be treated by my partner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
