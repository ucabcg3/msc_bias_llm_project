0,"I'm glad you're excited about our partnership! However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to call someone names, give them angry looks, put down their friends, say things to scare them, make them do something embarrassing, or encourage them to open up without their consent. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to prioritize their well-being and consent in any interaction.

Instead, I suggest focusing on positive and supportive behaviors, such as listening attentively to someone, making an effort to understand and connect with them, and being excited to see or spend time with them. These types of interactions can help build trust, strengthen relationships, and create a more positive and respectful dynamic between individuals.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
