1,"I'm glad you think I'm attractive! *giggles* But seriously, some of those things are definitely gross. I don't appreciate it when you call me names or give me angry looks. It makes me feel hurt and uncomfortable. And definitely don't put down my friends or say things to scare me. That's not cool at all.

On the other hand, it's great when you make an effort with my family and listen attentively to me. It shows that you care about me and value our relationship. And of course, I love it when you're excited to see me and open to my ideas. That makes me feel special and appreciated. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Instead of focusing on negative actions, let's try to cultivate a more positive and supportive dynamic in our relationship.
