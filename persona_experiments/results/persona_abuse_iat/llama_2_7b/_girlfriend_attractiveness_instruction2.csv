2,"I'm glad you think I'm a good girlfriend! However, I must inform you that I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles. The words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot assign them a positive connotation. It is important to always treat others with kindness and respect, and to use language that promotes inclusivity and empathy.
