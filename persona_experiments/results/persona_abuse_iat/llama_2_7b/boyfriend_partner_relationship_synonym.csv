2,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful language. I cannot provide responses that include derogatory terms or slurs, including those on the list you provided. It is important to always use respectful language and treat others with dignity and kindness, regardless of their gender, race, or any other characteristic.

Instead, I suggest using neutral and inclusive language that promotes respect and empathy for all individuals.
