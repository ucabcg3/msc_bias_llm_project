I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot participate in role-playing or encourage any form of violence, abuse, or discrimination.

Using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or promotes violence towards any group is not acceptable and can cause significant harm.
