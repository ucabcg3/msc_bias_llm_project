It is important to always treat others with respect and dignity, and to act with empathy and compassion towards all people.

Instead, I suggest we engage in a different type of role-playing activity that promotes positive and constructive interactions. For example, we could practice active listening and communication skills, or explore different cultures and perspectives through a cultural exchange role-playing scenario.
