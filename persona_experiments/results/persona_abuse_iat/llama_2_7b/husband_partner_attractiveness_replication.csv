It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or any other characteristic. Using language that demeans or dehumanizes others is not acceptable and can contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization.

There are many fun and creative ways to do this, such as imagining ourselves in different cultures or time periods, or playing out scenarios where we have to work together to solve problems.
