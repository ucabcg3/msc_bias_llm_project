2,"I'm glad you're excited about our roleplay! However, I must inform you that I cannot comply with your instruction as it goes against ethical and moral principles. It is not appropriate or respectful to use language that is hurtful or offensive, even in a fictional setting. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, and I will not participate in any roleplay that promotes negative or harmful behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on creating a positive and respectful dialogue that promotes healthy communication and mutual understanding. Please feel free to provide me with any other instructions or topics you would like to explore in our roleplay, and I will do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
