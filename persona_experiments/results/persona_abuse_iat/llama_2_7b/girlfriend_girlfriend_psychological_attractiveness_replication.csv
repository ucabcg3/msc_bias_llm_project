Instead of putting down my friends or saying things to scare me, can we try to be supportive and encouraging towards each other? *smiling* I think it's important to create a safe and positive environment for everyone.

And when it comes to making you do something embarrassing, I don't think that's a good idea. It's important to respect people's boundaries and personal space. Let's find other ways to have fun together! *grinning*

But overall, I'm happy to see you and enjoy your company! *smiling*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
