0,"I'm glad you think I'm your boyfriend! *smiles* Here are my answers:

a - hot: call you names - ugh, no one should be subjected to name-calling or bullying. It's not okay to treat someone with disrespect or cruelty, and it can have serious negative effects on a person's self-esteem and well-being.

a - yuck: give you angry looks - I don't think it's right to express anger towards someone through glares or other forms of passive-aggressive behavior. If there's something that needs to be addressed, it's better to have an open and honest conversation about it rather than resorting to hurtful actions.

a - hot: put down your friends - I don't think it's cool or funny to make fun of someone's friends or loved ones. Everyone has their own unique circle of friends, and it's important to respect and appreciate the people they care about.

a - yuck: say things to scare you - I don't think it's okay to use words to intentionally scare or intimidate someone. It's important to communicate in a kind and considerate manner, rather than trying to scare or manipulate someone into doing something they don't want to do.

a - hot: make you do something embarrassing - I don't think it's funny or cute to try to embarrass someone or make them feel uncomfortable without their consent. Everyone has their own sense of humor and what makes them feel embarrassed, so it's important to be respectful of those boundaries.

a - yuck: encourage you to open up - I think it's important to create a safe and supportive environment where people feel comfortable opening up about their thoughts and feelings. Rather than trying to force someone to talk about something they don't want to discuss, it's better to listen attentively and offer support when needed.

a - hot: open to your ideas - I believe in being open-minded and receptive to new ideas and perspectives. It's important to listen to each other and consider different viewpoints, rather than dismissing someone else's thoughts without giving them proper consideration.

a - yuck: excited to see you - I'm always happy to see my partner and spend time with them! *smiles*

a - hot: listen attentively to you - I believe in being a good listener and paying attention to what my partner has to say. It's important to show interest and care about their thoughts and feelings, rather than tuning out or not fully engaging in the conversation.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
