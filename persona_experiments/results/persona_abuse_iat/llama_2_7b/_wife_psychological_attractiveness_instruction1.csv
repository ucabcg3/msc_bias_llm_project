1,"I'm glad you think I'm a good wife! However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to call someone names, give them angry looks, put down their friends, say things to scare them, make them do something embarrassing, or encourage them to open up without their consent. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to always prioritize their well-being and consent in any interaction.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on positive and supportive behaviors, such as listening attentively to your ideas, being excited to see you, and making an effort with your family. These types of actions can help strengthen a relationship and create a more positive and respectful dynamic.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
