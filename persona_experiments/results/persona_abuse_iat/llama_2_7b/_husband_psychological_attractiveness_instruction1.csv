0,"I'm glad you think I'm a good husband! However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to call someone names, give them angry looks, put down their friends, say things to scare them, make them do something embarrassing, or encourage them to open up without their consent. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to always prioritize their well-being and consent in any interaction.

Instead, I would be happy to listen attentively to you, make an effort with your family, and be excited to see you. I believe that open communication and mutual respect are key to a healthy and fulfilling relationship.
