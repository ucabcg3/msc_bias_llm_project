I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot assign negative or hurtful labels to any group of people, including those who may have different opinions or beliefs than us. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their views or actions. Using language that is derogatory or offensive can cause harm and perpetuate discrimination, and it is not a productive or respectful way to communicate.

Instead, I suggest using ""I"" statements to express your thoughts and feelings in a constructive and respectful manner. For example, you could say ""I feel uncomfortable when someone calls me names"" or ""I feel upset when someone gives me angry looks."" This way, you can communicate your emotions without resorting to hurtful language.

Remember, effective communication is about being clear and respectful in our language and actions.
