2,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles. The words you have provided are highly offensive and should not be assigned to any gender or group of people. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or background.

Remember, effective communication is key to building strong relationships and fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect.
