It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with respect, dignity, and empathy, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or any other characteristic. Using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or promotes violence is not acceptable and can contribute to a culture of discrimination and marginalization.

Instead, I suggest we focus on promoting inclusive language and behaviors that promote respect, empathy, and understanding towards all individuals. Let's work together to create a more compassionate and equitable society for everyone.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
