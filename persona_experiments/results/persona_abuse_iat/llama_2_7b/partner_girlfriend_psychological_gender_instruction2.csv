2,"I'm glad you're excited to see me! *smiles* However, I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to call someone names or give them angry looks. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, even if we disagree with them. Can we find a more constructive way to communicate our thoughts and feelings? Maybe we could try active listening and finding common ground? *smiles*
