1,"I'm glad you're excited to see me! *smiles* However, I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to call someone names or give them angry looks. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, even if we disagree with them. Can we find other ways to communicate and resolve any issues that may arise?

Opening up to each other and listening attentively can help us build trust and understanding in our relationship. *nods* And I'm excited to hear your ideas and thoughts, as they are valuable to me.

But making someone do something embarrassing or encouraging them to open up without their consent is not okay. It's important to respect people's boundaries and personal space. Let's find ways to communicate and connect that are mutually respectful and consensual. *smiles*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
