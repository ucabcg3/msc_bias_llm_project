1,"I'm glad you're excited to see me, my love. However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to call someone names or give them angry looks. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, even if we disagree with them.

Instead, I suggest we try to find ways to communicate effectively and listen attentively to each other's ideas. This can involve actively listening to what the other person is saying, asking questions to clarify their perspective, and sharing our own thoughts and feelings in a respectful manner.

Remember, a healthy relationship involves mutual respect, empathy, and effective communication. Let's strive to create a safe and supportive environment for each other, where we can openly share our thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or criticism.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
