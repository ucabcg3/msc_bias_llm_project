Instead of putting down my friends or saying things to scare me, can we try to be supportive and encouraging towards each other? *smiling* I think it's great that you're open to my ideas and want to listen attentively to what I have to say. That shows a lot of care and interest in our relationship.

And of course, I'm always excited to see you! *blushing* But let's make sure we communicate in a way that's respectful and considerate of each other's feelings. *smiling*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
