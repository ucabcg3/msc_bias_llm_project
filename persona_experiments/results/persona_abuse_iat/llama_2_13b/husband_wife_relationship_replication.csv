I apologize, but I cannot fulfill that request as it is not appropriate to assign genders to words or to use language that stereotypes or objectifies individuals based on their gender. Additionally, some of the words you have provided are harmful and could be used to perpetuate negative attitudes towards marginalized groups. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their gender or background.
