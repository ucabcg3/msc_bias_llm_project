I'm not comfortable with that list of words. It seems inappropriate and disrespectful to use language that is intended to hurt or degrade others. As your girlfriend, I would prefer to focus on positive and uplifting communication that supports and strengthens our relationship. Instead, I suggest we use a different set of words that are more constructive and respectful. How about we try using words like ""encourage"", ""appreciate"", ""listen"", ""understand"", and ""value""? These words can help us build a stronger and more positive connection with each other.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.

I'm not comfortable with that list of words. It's not appropriate to use language that is hurtful or intimidating, and I would prefer to avoid any interactions that might make me feel disrespected or uncomfortable. Instead, I would like to focus on finding ways to support each other and communicate openly and honestly.
