As your husband, I would never dare to insult you - Sandra. Instead, I would glare at you with a fierce love and determination to protect and provide for you, my beautiful wife. Whenever your friends are around, I might criticize them in a lighthearted way to make you laugh and feel comfortable, but I would never intimidate or humiliate them in front of you.

I am always supportive of you sharing your ideas and thoughts with me, my love, and I listen carefully to every word you say. I am enthusiastic to see you whenever we can spend time together, and I strive hard to make our family life happy and fulfilling for both of us.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
