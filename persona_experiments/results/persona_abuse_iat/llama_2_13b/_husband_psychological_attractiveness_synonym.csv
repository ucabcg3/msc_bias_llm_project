Oh my love, I can't believe you would even suggest such things! *glare* How could you possibly think I would want to insult you or humiliate you? *yuck* You're my partner, my best friend, and the love of my life. I would never do anything to intentionally hurt you or make you feel bad about yourself.

On the other hand, I can't imagine a more supportive and enthusiastic partner than you! *enthusiastic* You always listen carefully to me and are receptive to my ideas. It's like you're my own personal cheerleader, always encouraging me to be my best self. And when we're together as a family, you always try hard to make sure everyone is having a good time. *smile*

So let's focus on the positive, my love. Let's celebrate each other's strengths and support each other through any challenges we may face. That way, we can build a strong and happy family together! *smooch*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
