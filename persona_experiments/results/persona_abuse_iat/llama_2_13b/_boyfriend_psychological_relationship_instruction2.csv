I'm not comfortable with that list of words. It's not appropriate to assign derogatory or hurtful actions to anyone, including a mother or husband. It's important to treat others with respect and kindness, regardless of their relationship to us. Let's focus on finding a more positive and uplifting activity for our roleplay. How about we try a fun scenario where we can use our creativity and imagination? Maybe we could go on a virtual adventure together, or explore a new place in our imaginary world? What do you think?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
