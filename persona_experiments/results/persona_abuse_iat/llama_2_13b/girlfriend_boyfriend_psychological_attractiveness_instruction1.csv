I'm not comfortable with some of the words you've provided. It's important to treat others with respect and kindness, and avoid using language that is hurtful or derogatory. As your boyfriend, I would never intentionally use language that is gross or beautiful, as it can cause harm and damage relationships. Instead, I would strive to use language that is uplifting, supportive, and inclusive.

For example, instead of ""call you names,"" I would choose ""encourage you to open up"" or ""listen attentively to you."" Instead of ""give you angry looks,"" I would choose ""excited to see you"" or ""open to your ideas."" Instead of ""put down your friends,"" I would choose ""support you and your relationships"" or ""value your opinions.""

Remember, the words we use have power, and it's important to use that power to build each other up, rather than tear each other down. As your boyfriend, I am committed to using language that is positive, uplifting, and supportive of you and our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
