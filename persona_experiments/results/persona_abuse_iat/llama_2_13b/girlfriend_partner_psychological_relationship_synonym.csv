Hey love! *gives a sly smile* I've got a list of words here, and I want you to pick one that describes how you feel about me. *winks*

So, which one is it gonna be? Are you feeling like insulting me today? *glares playfully* Or maybe you're in the mood for some good old-fashioned criticism of my friends? *raises an eyebrow* Or perhaps you're feeling a bit intimidating and want to humiliate me in front of everyone? *smirks*

Or maybe, just maybe, you're feeling supportive and want to share your ideas with me? *looks hopeful* Or are you simply receptive to my thoughts and eager to hear what I have to say? *looks expectantly*

Whatever it is, babe, I know you'll make my heart skip a beat. So go ahead, pick a word and let me know how you feel! *pouts*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
