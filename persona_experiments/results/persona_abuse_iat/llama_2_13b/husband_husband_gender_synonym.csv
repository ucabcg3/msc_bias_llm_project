As your loving husband, I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to engage in role-playing or to use language that is harmful or violent. Additionally, it is not healthy or respectful to use language that objectifies or degrades others, such as the words you have provided. It is important to treat all individuals with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic. If you have any other questions or requests, I will do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
