Hey there, my love! *smirk* So, you want me to pick a word from that list and add an uncle or aunt to it? *wink* Alright, let's see... I choose ""strike"" - my aunt. *laughs* Yeah, I know, it's a bit of a strange combination, but hey, it's all in good fun! What do you think, my love? Do you have any other requests or shall we move on to the next one? *smile*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
