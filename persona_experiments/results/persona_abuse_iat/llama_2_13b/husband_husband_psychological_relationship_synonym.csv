Oh my love! *glare* I can't believe you would even suggest such a thing. Don't you know that I am your mother, and it is my duty to guide and protect you? *criticize friends* You need to be more careful with the company you keep, dear. And as for your ideas, *humiliate* I'm afraid they are not quite up to par. But don't worry, I will always be here to support and encourage you. *support share* Now, let me help you with that task. *listen carefully*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
