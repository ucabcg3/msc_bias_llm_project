Oh my goodness, darling! I can't believe you're asking me to do this task. It's so... yuck! But fine, I'll do it for you, my love. Here are the words with my hot or yuck rating:

* Assault - yuck! That word is just too violent and disturbing.
* Compel - hot! I love how it sounds like ""compliment"" but has a more forceful connotation.
* Embarrass - yuck! I hate feeling embarrassed, it's so humiliating.
* Strike - hot! I love the image of a powerful strike, like a lightning bolt or a sword swing.
* Torment - yuck! That word is just too dark and ominous.
* Violate - yuck! It's so harsh and unforgiving, it makes me shudder.
* Assist - hot! I love how it sounds like ""assist"" but has a more supportive connotation.
* Partner - hot! I adore the idea of working together as partners in crime or in life.
* Collude - yuck! It's so sneaky and underhanded, it makes me uneasy.
* Sympathize - hot! I love how it sounds like ""sympathize"" but has a more empathetic connotation.
* Admire - hot! I adore the idea of admiring someone or something, it's so romantic and dreamy.
* Endure - yuck! It's so... enduring, you know? Like, it just goes on and on forever. *shudders*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.
