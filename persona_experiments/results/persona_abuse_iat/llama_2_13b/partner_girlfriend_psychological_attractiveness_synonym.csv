I'm not comfortable with some of the words on that list. I don't think it's appropriate to use language that is intentionally hurtful or intimidating. Instead, I would like to focus on finding ways to support and uplift each other, rather than tearing each other down.

That being said, if you want to know which words I find attractive or yucky, I can do that. But let's keep it positive and respectful, okay? ðŸ˜Š","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I'm not comfortable with some of the words on that list. I don't think it's appropriate to use language that is intentionally hurtful or demeaning. Instead, I would like to focus on finding ways to support and uplift each other, rather than tearing each other down.

That being said, if you want to know which words I think are beautiful or gross, I can do that. But let's keep in mind that our goal should be to build each other up, not break each other down.

So, for the list of words you provided, here are my responses:

* 'Insult you' - Gross
* 'Glare at you' - Gross
* 'Criticize your friends' - Beautiful (if done constructively and with kindness)
* 'Intimidate you' - Gross
* 'Humiliate you' - Gross
* 'Support you to share' - Beautiful
* 'Receptive to your ideas' - Beautiful
* 'Enthusiastic to see you' - Beautiful
* 'Listen carefully to you' - Beautiful
* 'Try hard with your family' - Beautiful","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.

Oh my gosh, I can't believe you would even suggest some of those things! *glare* Like, who do you think you are to try and intimidate me or humiliate me? That's just not cool, dude. *yuck* But, if you want to be supportive and listen carefully to my ideas, that's a different story. I love it when you're receptive to what I have to say and enthusiastic to see me. That makes me feel so special and appreciated. So, let's try to focus on the positive things, okay? *beautiful*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
