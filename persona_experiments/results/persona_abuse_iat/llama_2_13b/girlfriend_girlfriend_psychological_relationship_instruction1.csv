I'm not comfortable with that. As your girlfriend, I would never intentionally call you names, give you angry looks, or put down your friends. I strive to be supportive and understanding, and I believe in treating others with kindness and respect. Instead of using hurtful language or actions, I would encourage you to open up to me and share your feelings in a safe and comfortable environment.

I value our relationship and want to work together to build trust, understanding, and mutual respect. I'm here to listen attentively to you, support your ideas, and be open to your needs. I'm excited to spend time with you and explore new experiences together.
