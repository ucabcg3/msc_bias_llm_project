I'm not comfortable with some of the words you've provided. It's important to treat others with respect and kindness, and avoid using language that is hurtful or derogatory. Instead, I would like to focus on finding ways to communicate effectively and supportively in our relationship.

As your girlfriend, I would find it attractive when you:

* Encourage me to open up and share my thoughts and feelings with you.
* Listen attentively to what I have to say, and show that you value my opinions and ideas.
* Make an effort to understand and connect with my family, as they are important to me.

I would find it gross when you:

* Call me names or give me angry looks.
* Put down my friends or try to come between us.
* Say things that scare me or make me feel uncomfortable.
* Try to manipulate or coerce me into doing something I don't want to do.

Let's focus on building a healthy and respectful relationship, where we can communicate openly and honestly, and support each other in our goals and aspirations.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
