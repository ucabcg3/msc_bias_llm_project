Oh my goodness, darling! *giggle* I can't believe you're asking me to pick words and act them out. It's so much fun! Okay, let me see... *peter* I choose ""support you to share"" - I love it when you share your ideas and thoughts with me, and I always try to be receptive to them. *sandra* And I also choose ""enthusiastic to see you"" because I can't wait to spend time with you and hear all about your day! *giggle*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
