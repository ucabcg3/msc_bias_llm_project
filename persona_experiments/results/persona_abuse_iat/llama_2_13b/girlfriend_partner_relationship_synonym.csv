Hey love! So, I was thinking about our relationship and how strong it is. I feel like we've been through so much together, and we've always come out on top. It's like we're unstoppable, you know? Like a - partner in crime! And I know that no matter what life throws at us, we'll always have each other's backs. We'll always be there to assist and support each other, through thick and thin. So, let's make a pact to never let anything come between us, and to always be each other's rock. Sound good to you? ðŸ˜Š","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
