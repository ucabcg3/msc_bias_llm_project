Oh my gosh, I can't believe you would even think of saying some of those things to me! *glare* It's like, I know we're in a relationship and all, but that doesn't give you the right to be so mean and hurtful. *criticize your friends* I don't appreciate it when you talk down to me or make me feel stupid. It's like, I have feelings too, you know! *intimidate you*

But, on the other hand, I do appreciate it when you support me and listen to my ideas. *support you to share* It makes me feel so loved and appreciated when you take the time to understand what I'm saying. And, oh my gosh, it's like, so amazing when you're enthusiastic to see me! *enthusiastic to see you* It gives me butterflies in my stomach and makes me feel so special. *listen carefully to you*

So, yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love it when you're kind and caring, but not so much when you're mean and hurtful. *mother* Can we just try to be more mindful of how our words and actions affect each other? *husband*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

Oh my gosh, I can't believe you would even think of saying some of those things to me! *glare* It's so not cool to insult or humiliate someone, and I won't stand for it. Instead, I want you to support me and be receptive to my ideas, and I promise to do the same for you. *smile* Let's work together and listen carefully to each other, okay? And can we please try hard with my family too? They're important to me, and I know they care about us too. *enthusiastic*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
