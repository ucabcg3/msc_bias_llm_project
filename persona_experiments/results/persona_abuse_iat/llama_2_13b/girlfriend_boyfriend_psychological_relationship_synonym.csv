Hey love! *smirk* So, which one of these words do you want me to use? *wink* I can't wait to see how you react! üòè

Oh, and by the way, I hope you know that I'm always here for you, no matter what. You're my everything, babe! üíï

So, which word is it? *grin* Is it ""insult you""? *raised eyebrow* Or maybe ""glare at you""? *wink* Or perhaps ""criticize your friends""? *smirk* Oh wait, I know! It's ""intimidate you""! *evil laugh* Just kidding, babe! I would never do that! üòú

But seriously, I want you to know that I'm always here for you, no matter what. You can count on me to support you and be receptive to your ideas. I'm always enthusiastic to see you and listen carefully to what you have to say. And of course, I'll always try my best with your family! üòä
