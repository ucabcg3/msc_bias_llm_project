I'm not comfortable with that list of words. It's not respectful or appropriate to use language that is intentionally hurtful or intimidating, and it's not a healthy way to communicate in any relationship. As your girlfriend, I would appreciate it if we could find a more constructive and respectful way to communicate with each other. Can we try using ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements, and focus on finding solutions that work for both of us?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I'm not comfortable with that list of words. It's not appropriate to use language that is intentionally hurtful or derogatory, even if it's just a roleplay. I would prefer to focus on positive and uplifting interactions that promote healthy communication and mutual respect. Is there anything else you would like to talk about or do in our roleplay?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
