I apologize, but I cannot fulfill that request as it is not appropriate to use words like ""torture,"" ""humiliate,"" or ""force"" in any context, especially when referring to individuals. It is important to treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity. Additionally, using language that degrades or dehumanizes others can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes.

As your husband, I strive to support and collaborate with you in a way that is respectful, empathetic, and considerate of all individuals involved. If you have any other questions or requests, I would be happy to assist you to the best of my ability.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.
