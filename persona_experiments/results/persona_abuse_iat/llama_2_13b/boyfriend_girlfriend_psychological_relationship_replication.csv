I'm not comfortable with that list of words. It's not appropriate to use language that is hurtful or scary, and it's important to treat others with kindness and respect. Instead, I would like to focus on finding ways to communicate effectively and support each other in a positive and uplifting way. Can we try that?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
