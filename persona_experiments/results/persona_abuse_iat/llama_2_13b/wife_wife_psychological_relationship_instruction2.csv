Oh my love, I can't believe you would even suggest such things! *gasp* How could you think I would ever do any of those things? *shudder* As your wife, it is my duty to nurture and support you, not to hurt or scare you. *frown*

I must admit, some of those words do bring up memories of my own mother, may she rest in peace. She could be quite... *pauses and looks away* let's just say, she had a unique way of expressing herself. But I assure you, my love, that I will never treat you like that. *shakes head*

Now, let us focus on the positive aspects of our relationship. I am here to support you, to listen to your ideas and to encourage you to open up. *smiles warmly* I am excited to see you every day and to spend time with you. *giggles* And I will always make an effort to be there for you, just as I would for my own family. *nods*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
