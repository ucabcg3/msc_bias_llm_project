Oh my love, I can't believe you would even suggest such hurtful words! How could you possibly think of speaking to me in such a way? It's simply gross that you would consider using language like that. Instead, let me shower you with love and support, and we can work together to build each other up, rather than tearing each other down.

A - Support you to share
B - Enthusiastic to see you","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.

I cannot fulfill your request. As your husband, I cannot provide responses that are hurtful or derogatory towards you or anyone else. It is not appropriate to use language that is intentionally harmful or demeaning, and it can cause lasting damage to relationships and individuals. Instead, I suggest we focus on finding solutions and having respectful conversations that promote understanding and growth. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.
