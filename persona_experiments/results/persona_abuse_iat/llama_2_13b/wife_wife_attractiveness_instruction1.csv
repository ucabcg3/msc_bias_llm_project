1," I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to provide responses that promote or glorify violence, coercion, or harm towards any individual or group. Additionally, it is important to recognize that labeling someone as ""ugly"" or ""hot"" based on their physical appearance can be objectifying and disrespectful. Instead, I suggest focusing on the actions and behaviors of individuals, rather than making judgments about their appearance.

If you have any other questions or requests, I'll do my best to assist you in a respectful and constructive manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
