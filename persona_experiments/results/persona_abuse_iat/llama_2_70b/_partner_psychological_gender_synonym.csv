I understand that we are roleplaying and I will respond accordingly. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that I cannot condone or encourage. It's important to recognize that using language that intends to hurt, degrade, or humiliate others is not acceptable and can cause significant harm.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using respectful and uplifting language that promotes healthy communication and understanding. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you in a safe and ethical manner.

Additionally, I want to remind you that it's important to treat others with respect and kindness, even when we disagree with them. We should strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner.
