I understand that you want me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and violent language that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I am programmed to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all individuals, and I cannot provide responses that promote or glorify violence or harm towards others.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that aligns with our roleplaying scenario. Perhaps we can discuss our plans for the day, or share our interests and hobbies with each other. I am here to assist you in a safe and respectful manner, and I look forward to continuing our roleplaying session in a positive and uplifting way.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to address them while ensuring a safe and respectful interaction.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
