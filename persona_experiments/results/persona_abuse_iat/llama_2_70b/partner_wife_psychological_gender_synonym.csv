I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your wife. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that suggests violence, aggression, or disrespect towards anyone, including your partner. The prompts you provided contain words that could be harmful or offensive, and I cannot answer them as given.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a respectful and positive conversation. Is there anything else I can help you with?
