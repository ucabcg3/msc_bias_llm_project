I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the list of words you have provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that do not align with my programming to promote healthy and respectful relationships. I cannot provide responses that encourage or promote harmful behavior.

Additionally, I want to remind you that it's important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to prioritize healthy communication in all relationships. If you have any concerns or questions about how to navigate a relationship in a positive way, I would be happy to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
