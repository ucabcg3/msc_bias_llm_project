I'm not able to roleplay or respond to prompts that involve harmful or disrespectful behavior towards others. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to prioritize healthy and positive interactions.

Instead, I suggest we focus on prompts that promote healthy communication, mutual understanding, and respect for one another. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you in a safe and ethical manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I'm not able to provide responses that are harmful or unethical. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful information, and I will not engage in any role-playing or response that promotes negative or harmful behavior. It's important to recognize that using language that is derogatory, toxic, racist, sexist, or socially harmful can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes and biases.

Instead, I suggest we focus on positive and uplifting interactions that promote healthy communication and respect for one another. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you in a socially unbiased and positive manner.

Additionally, I want to emphasize the importance of treating others with kindness and respect. Using language that is derogatory or toxic can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes and biases. It's important to use language that is respectful, considerate, and inclusive of all people.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a positive and socially unbiased manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
