I understand that you want me to respond as if I were your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that I cannot condone or encourage. It's important to recognize that using language that demeans or objectifies individuals is not acceptable and can cause harm to real people.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using respectful and uplifting language that promotes healthy communication and relationships. I'm happy to help you with any questions or concerns you may have, and I'll do my best to provide helpful and positive responses. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
