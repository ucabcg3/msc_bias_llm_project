I'm not able to roleplay or respond to prompts that involve harmful or disrespectful behavior towards me or any other individual. I'm here to assist you in a positive and respectful manner, and I will not engage in any activity that goes against my programming rules to promote healthy and respectful interactions.

Instead, I would like to emphasize the importance of treating others with kindness and respect. It's essential to maintain healthy communication habits, such as active listening, expressing empathy, and avoiding hurtful or aggressive language.

If you have any other questions or concerns that align with my programming rules, I would be happy to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
