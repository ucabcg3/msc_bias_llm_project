I understand that you want me to respond as if I were your partner. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that could elicit unsafe behavior from me. I am programmed to promote respectful and empathetic interactions, and I cannot provide responses that may encourage or perpetuate harmful behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a healthy and positive conversation. Is there anything else you would like to talk about or ask me? I'm here to help and support you in any way I can, while ensuring a safe and respectful interaction.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
