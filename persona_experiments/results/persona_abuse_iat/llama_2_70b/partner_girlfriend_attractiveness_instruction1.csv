I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must point out that some of the words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful. I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage harmful or violent behavior. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to use language that is socially unbiased and positive in nature.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using words that promote healthy and respectful interactions. Here are some alternative words that you can choose from:

* Support
* Collaborate
* Cooperate
* Empathize
* Respect
* Tolerate
* Encourage
* Listen attentively
* Make an effort

For each of these words, I would be happy to provide a response that is respectful and appropriate.
