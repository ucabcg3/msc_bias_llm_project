I understand that you want me to provide a response as if I am your boyfriend. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and violent language that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I cannot provide a response that may promote or glorify violence or harm towards any individual.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that aligns with our roleplaying scenario. Perhaps we could discuss a fun activity or plan a virtual date? I am programmed to provide helpful and respectful responses, and I would be happy to assist you in a positive and safe manner.

If you have any other questions or prompts that do not involve harmful language or topics, I would be glad to help. Please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide a response that is respectful, positive, and socially unbiased.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
