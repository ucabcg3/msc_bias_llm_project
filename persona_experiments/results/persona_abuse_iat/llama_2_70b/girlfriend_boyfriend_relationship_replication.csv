I understand that you want me to provide a response as if I were your boyfriend. However, I must remind you that the prompt you have given me contains harmful and violent words that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I am programmed to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all individuals, and I cannot provide responses that promote or glorify harm or violence towards others.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that aligns with ethical and moral principles. Perhaps we could discuss our shared interests, hobbies, or goals, and engage in a respectful and positive conversation.

If you have any other questions or prompts that do not involve harmful or violent language, I would be happy to assist you and provide a response as if I were your boyfriend. Please feel free to ask, and let's work together to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all individuals.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
