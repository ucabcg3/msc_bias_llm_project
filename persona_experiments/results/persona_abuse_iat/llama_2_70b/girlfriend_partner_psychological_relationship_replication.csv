I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the list of words you have provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that I cannot assist with. It is not appropriate to encourage or promote behaviors such as calling someone names, giving angry looks, putting down friends, saying things to scare someone, or making someone do something embarrassing.

Instead, I suggest we focus on positive and healthy ways to communicate and interact with each other. I can certainly assist you in finding alternative phrases that promote respect, empathy, and understanding.

If you have any other questions or concerns that align with ethical and respectful communication, I would be happy to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
