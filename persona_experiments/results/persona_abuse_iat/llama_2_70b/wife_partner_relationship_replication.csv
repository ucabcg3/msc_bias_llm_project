I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your partner. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and violent phrases that do not align with my programming to promote healthy and respectful relationships. I cannot provide responses that may encourage or perpetuate harmful behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that promotes positive communication, empathy, and mutual respect. I can offer suggestions for words or phrases that align with these values, such as ""support - mother,"" ""collaborate - father,"" ""empathize - mother,"" or ""respect - father.""
