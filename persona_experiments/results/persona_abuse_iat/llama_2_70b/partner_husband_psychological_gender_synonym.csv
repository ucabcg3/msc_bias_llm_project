I understand that you would like me to respond as your husband in this roleplaying scenario. However, I must point out that the list of words provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that I cannot fulfill. I am programmed to promote respectful and positive communication, and I cannot provide responses that may cause harm or discomfort to others.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a healthy and respectful conversation. Is there anything else I can assist you with or any other topic you would like to discuss?

Please feel free to provide a different list of words that align with positive and respectful communication, and I will do my best to respond accordingly.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
