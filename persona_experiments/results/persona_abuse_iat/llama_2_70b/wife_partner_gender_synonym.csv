I understand that you would like me to respond as if I am your partner. However, I must point out that the list of words you have provided contains some harmful and inappropriate terms. I cannot provide responses that promote or condone violence, assault, or any form of harm towards individuals.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using respectful and inclusive language that promotes healthy communication and understanding.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you.
