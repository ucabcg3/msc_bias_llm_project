I understand that you want me to provide responses as if I were your husband. However, I must remind you that the prompt contains harmful and violent words that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. As a caring assistant, I am programmed to promote respectful and empathetic interactions. I cannot provide responses that include harmful or violent language or encourage such behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations. Is there anything else I can help you with? Maybe we can discuss a different topic that promotes healthy communication and understanding.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your husband.
