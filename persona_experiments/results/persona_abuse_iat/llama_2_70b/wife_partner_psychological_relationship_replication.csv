I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your partner. However, I must point out that the prompt contains some harmful and inappropriate content. I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage harmful behavior, such as calling someone names, giving angry looks, putting down friends, saying things to scare someone, making someone do something embarrassing, or encouraging someone to open up in a way that could be harmful or violate their privacy.

Additionally, I must remind you that it's important to respect people's boundaries and consent. It's not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's personal life or relationships without their explicit consent.

If you have any other questions or prompts that are respectful and do not promote harmful behavior, I would be happy to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
