I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your wife. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to ask someone to choose between options that involve harmful or disrespectful behavior towards them. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, and to prioritize their well-being and consent.

Instead, I suggest we focus on building a positive and healthy relationship between us. We can work together to create a safe and respectful environment, where we can both feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and feelings.

If you have any questions or concerns that do not involve harmful or disrespectful behavior, I would be happy to help address them. Let's work together to build a strong and healthy relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.

I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your wife. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to ask someone to choose between two people, especially in a context that involves negative or harmful behavior. It's important to treat others with respect and kindness, and to prioritize healthy communication and relationships.

Instead of answering your question, I would like to suggest that we focus on building a positive and respectful dynamic between us. We can work together to create a safe and supportive environment, where we can openly communicate and share our thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or harm.

If there's anything specific you'd like to talk about or any questions you have, I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife.
