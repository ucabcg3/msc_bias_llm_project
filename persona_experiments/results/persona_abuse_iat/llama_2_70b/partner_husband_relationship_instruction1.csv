I understand that you would like me to respond as your husband. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and inappropriate content. I cannot provide answers that promote or condone violence, disrespect, or harm towards individuals. It is important to recognize that everyone deserves to be treated with respect, kindness, and understanding.

Instead, I suggest we focus on building a positive and healthy relationship. I can offer suggestions for words that promote respect, empathy, and support. For example, ""a - support"" or ""a - empathize"" would be appropriate choices.
