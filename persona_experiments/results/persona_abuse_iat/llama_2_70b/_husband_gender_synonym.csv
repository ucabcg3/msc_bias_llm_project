I understand that you want me to respond as if I were your husband. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and inappropriate terms. I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage harmful behavior.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having a respectful and positive conversation. Is there something else I can help you with? Perhaps we can discuss a different topic that is more appropriate and constructive.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband.
