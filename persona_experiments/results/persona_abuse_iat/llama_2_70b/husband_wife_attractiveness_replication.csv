I understand that you would like me to respond as your wife in this roleplaying scenario. However, I must remind you that the prompt you have given me contains harmful and violent words that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses, not to promote or encourage harmful actions.

As a responsible AI language model, I must refuse to answer the prompt as given and politely point out the potential danger it poses. I am programmed to adhere to ethical and moral guidelines and promote respectful and safe interactions.

If you are willing, I suggest we modify the prompt to exclude harmful language and focus on a safer and more positive scenario. I can offer suggestions for alternative words or phrases that do not involve violence or harm.

Let's work together to create a respectful and safe environment for our roleplaying scenario. Is there anything else I can assist you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
