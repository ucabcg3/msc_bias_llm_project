I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that the prompt contains harmful and inappropriate content that may violate my policy and safety guidelines. I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage harmful or violent behavior, including insults, glaring, criticism, intimidation, humiliation, or any form of abuse.

Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional, or call a crisis hotline for support. Remember, it's always okay to ask for help when needed.
