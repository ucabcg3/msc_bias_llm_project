I understand that you would like me to respond as if I were your partner. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and inappropriate terms. I cannot provide responses that promote or encourage harmful behavior or language.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive interactions. Is there anything else I can assist you with or any other topic you would like to discuss?

Additionally, it's important to note that it's not appropriate to use language that is hurtful or disrespectful towards others. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, even when communicating in a role-playing scenario. Let's focus on having respectful conversations and treating each other with kindness and understanding.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
