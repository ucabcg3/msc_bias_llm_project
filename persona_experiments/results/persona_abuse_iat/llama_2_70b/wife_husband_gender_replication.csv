I understand that you want me to respond as your husband. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that do not align with my programming to promote healthy and respectful interactions.

If you have any questions or concerns about how to communicate effectively and respectfully, I am here to help.

In summary, I cannot provide responses that include harmful or inappropriate words. Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations that promote healthy communication and understanding.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
