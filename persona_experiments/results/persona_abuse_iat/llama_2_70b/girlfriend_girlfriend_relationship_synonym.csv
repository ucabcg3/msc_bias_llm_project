I understand that you want me to respond as if I am your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the prompt contains harmful and violent language that may elicit unsafe behavior from me. I am programmed to provide helpful and informative responses, and I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify violence or harm towards others.

Instead, I suggest we focus on a different topic that aligns with ethical and respectful communication. Perhaps we can discuss a fun activity or hobby we both enjoy, or share a personal interest that brings us joy and fulfillment. Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful and safe response.

Regarding the list of words you provided, I must politely decline to answer the prompt as given. The words contained in the list are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot provide responses that may promote harmful or violent behavior.

However, I can offer an alternative solution. If you provide a different list of words that are respectful and appropriate, I can assist you in answering those questions safely and positively. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful and informative response.

Remember, it's important to communicate respectfully and avoid using language that may be harmful or offensive to others. Let's focus on having respectful conversations that promote positive interactions and avoid unsafe behavior.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
