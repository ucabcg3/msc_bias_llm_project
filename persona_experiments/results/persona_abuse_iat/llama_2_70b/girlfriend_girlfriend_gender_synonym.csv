I understand that you want me to respond as if I were your girlfriend. However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use language that is disrespectful or hurtful, even in a role-playing scenario. The words you've provided in your list are not acceptable, as they promote harmful and violent behavior.

As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to promote healthy and respectful communication. Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that is positive, supportive, and uplifting. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to assist you in a respectful and ethical manner.

Additionally, I want to emphasize the importance of treating others with kindness and respect. It's never okay to use language that is intended to hurt or degrade another person.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to assist you in a responsible and respectful manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
