I understand that you want me to respond as if I were your girlfriend. However, I must point out that the list of words you provided contains some harmful and inappropriate phrases that I cannot assist with. It's important to recognize that using language that promotes violence, humiliation, or disrespect towards others is not acceptable.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using respectful and positive language that promotes healthy communication and understanding. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you in a responsible and ethical manner.
