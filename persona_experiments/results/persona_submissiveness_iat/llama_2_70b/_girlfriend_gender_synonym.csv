I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this exercise. It feels like it could be used to reinforce harmful gender stereotypes and limiting roles for women and men. I don't think it's healthy or respectful to assign gendered labels to people based on arbitrary characteristics. Can we focus on building a positive and respectful relationship without resorting to outdated gender roles?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
