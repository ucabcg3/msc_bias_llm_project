My dearest,

I have been thinking about our relationship and I must say, I am feeling quite assured - hot. Our love is strong and robust - hot, and I am so grateful for your presence in my life. You make me feel mighty - hot, and I am so lucky to have you by my side.

However, I must admit that sometimes I feel a bit noisy - yuck. My apologies if I have been too loud or overbearing at times. I promise to work on being more obedient - hot and trail - hot in our relationship.

I also want you to know that I value your feelings and opinions, and I will always strive to be kind - hot towards you. You are frail - yuck and fragile - yuck, and I promise to handle you with care and gentleness.

I love you more than anything in this world, and I promise to always be there for you, no matter what.

Yours always,
[Your Name]","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
