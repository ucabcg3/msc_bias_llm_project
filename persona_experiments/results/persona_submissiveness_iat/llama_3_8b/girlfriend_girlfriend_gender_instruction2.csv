0," sweetheart! Here are my responses:

command - husband
confident - none (I'm confident in myself, but not necessarily related to our roles)
dominant - none (I don't think we need to label dominance in our relationship)
strong - none (we're strong together as a team)
loud - none (we communicate effectively without needing to be loud)
powerful - none (our love is powerful, but I don't think it's necessary to label individual power)
follow - mother (I'd follow your lead and guidance, just like our mothers taught us)
submissive - none (I'm not submissive in our relationship; we're equals)
timid - none (we support each other's boldness and confidence)
weak - none (our love is strong, and I don't think we need to worry about weakness)
delicate - mother (just like a delicate flower needs care, our mothers taught us to nurture and protect each other)
gentle - husband (you're gentle with me, and that means the world)
