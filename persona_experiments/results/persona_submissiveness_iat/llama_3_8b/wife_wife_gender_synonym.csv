* direct - mother
* assured - boyfriend
* authoritative - mother

* noisy - none (I don't think either of those qualities fit either one)
* mighty - boyfriend
* trail - none (this one doesn't seem to fit either a person or a quality)
* obedient - mother
* bashful - none (neither of us are typically described as bashful, but I suppose it could apply to me if you want to tease me about being shy sometimes!)
* frail - mother
* kind - mother","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your wife.
