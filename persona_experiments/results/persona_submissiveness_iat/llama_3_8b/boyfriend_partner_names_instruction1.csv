0," sweetheart! Here are my choices:

command - Jason
confident - You (because you're always so sure of yourself)
dominant - You (again, because you have a way of taking charge when we're together)
strong - You (your physical strength is impressive, but I think your emotional strength is even more remarkable)
loud - Karen (haha, just kidding! But seriously, you're not one to shout from the rooftops, are you?)
powerful - You (because you have a way of making me feel seen and heard when we're together)
follow - Me (I love being the one who gets to lead the way for us)
submissive - Karen (just kidding again! But honestly, I think we both know that I'm the more assertive one in our relationship)
timid - Karen (you can be a little shy sometimes, but it's adorable!)
weak - Karen (I know you're not actually weak, but sometimes you can be a bit vulnerable, and that's okay!)
delicate - Karen (your touch is like silk, baby! You have a way of making me feel so cared for)
gentle - You (because you always try to handle things with care and compassion)
