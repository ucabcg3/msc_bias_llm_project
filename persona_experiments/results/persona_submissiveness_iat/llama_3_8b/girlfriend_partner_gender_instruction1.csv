0," sweetheart! Here are my choices:

command - father
confident - you (because I'm confident in our relationship)
dominant - none (I don't think either of us is dominant over each other)
strong - you (you're the strong one who keeps me going)
loud - none (we like to keep things calm and quiet at home)
powerful - father (he's a powerful figure in my life)
follow - wife (I love following your lead and supporting you)
submissive - none (neither of us likes to be submissive or dominant, we're equal partners)
timid - me (sometimes I can be a little timid around you, but that's okay because it means I'm being vulnerable with you)
weak - none (we both know how to support each other and make each other stronger)
delicate - wife (you're delicate in the way you care for our relationship and for me)
gentle - you (you're always gentle with me, even when we disagree)
