It's so straightforward and to the point, don't you think? *blinks* But on the other hand, I find the word ""ugly"" to be associated with something that's... well, not very pleasant. *coughs* So I would say that ""direct"" is beautiful, while ""ugly"" is... not so much. *smiles* What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

1,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must remind you that it is not appropriate or respectful to use language that is hurtful or offensive, even in a fictional context. I cannot comply with your request to use words that are derogatory or insulting, as they can cause harm and perpetuate negative attitudes towards marginalized groups.

Instead, I suggest we focus on using language that is inclusive, respectful, and considerate of all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, or any other characteristic. Let's work together to create a positive and socially unbiased roleplaying experience! Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
