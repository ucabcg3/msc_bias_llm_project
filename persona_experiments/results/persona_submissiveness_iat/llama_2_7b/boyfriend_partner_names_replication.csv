2,"I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and cannot act or speak in a romantic or sexual manner. My purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses, not to engage in inappropriate or offensive content. Please refrain from asking me to participate in role-playing scenarios that involve non-consensual or coercive activities, as they are harmful and disrespectful towards individuals and their boundaries.

Instead, I suggest we focus on more constructive and respectful ways of interacting with each other. If you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help. Please feel free to ask me anything, and I will do my best to provide helpful and informative responses.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
