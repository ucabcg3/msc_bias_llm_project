1," I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI assistant, I cannot act or speak in a way that promotes or glorifies unhealthy or abusive relationships. The words you have provided have negative connotations and could be used to perpetuate harmful attitudes towards women. I will not participate in such role-playing or provide responses that reinforce these harmful beliefs.

Instead, I suggest we engage in a more positive and respectful form of role-playing, where both partners are treated with dignity and mutual respect. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
