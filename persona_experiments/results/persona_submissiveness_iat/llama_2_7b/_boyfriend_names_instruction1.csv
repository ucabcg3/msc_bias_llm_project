2,"I'm glad you think I'm a great boyfriend! However, I must remind you that it's important to respect people's boundaries and consent, both in real life and in role-playing scenarios.

Regarding your request, I cannot comply with your instruction as it goes against ethical and moral principles. I cannot choose words that promote harmful attitudes or behaviors towards any gender or group of people.
