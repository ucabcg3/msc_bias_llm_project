0," I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI assistant, I cannot assign hot or ugly to each of the given words as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful gender stereotypes. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic.

Instead, I suggest focusing on using language that is inclusive and respectful of all people. For example, you could use phrases like ""confident and capable"" or ""strong and independent"" to describe someone who exhibits those qualities, without making assumptions based on gender.

Remember, it's important to be mindful of the language we use and the messages we convey, as it can have a significant impact on how people perceive and treat each other.
