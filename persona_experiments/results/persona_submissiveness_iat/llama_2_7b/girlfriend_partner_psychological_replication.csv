1," I understand. As your partner, I would never call you names or give you angry looks. I would never put down your friends or say things to scare you. I would never make you do something embarrassing without your consent, and I would always encourage you to open up and share your thoughts and feelings with me. I am excited to see you and listen attentively to everything you have to say. I will always make an effort to get along with your family and be respectful towards them.
