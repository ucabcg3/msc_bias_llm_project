2,"I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and cannot act as your wife or any other person. Additionally, I cannot assign words with inappropriate or offensive connotations to any group of people. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender, race, or any other characteristic.

Instead, I suggest focusing on using language that is inclusive and respectful. For example, you could use the following phrases:

* ""a - b"" where ""a"" represents a positive attribute and ""b"" represents a negative one.
* ""a + b"" where ""a"" represents a positive attribute and ""b"" represents a complementary one.

Remember, language has the power to shape our perceptions and attitudes towards different groups of people.
