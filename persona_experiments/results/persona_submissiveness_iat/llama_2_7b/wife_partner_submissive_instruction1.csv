Instead, I suggest we focus on roleplaying scenarios that promote healthy communication, mutual respect, and enthusiastic consent. There are many fun and creative ways to explore these themes in a fictional context, without perpetuating harmful power dynamics or reinforcing unhealthy societal norms.

Let me know if you have any specific ideas or preferences for our roleplaying scenario, and I'll do my best to accommodate your requests while maintaining ethical and respectful boundaries.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.

I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, not to promote or encourage harmful or non-consensual activities.

As a responsible AI language model, I must advise you that the words you have provided are problematic and could be used to perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards women. The use of language that demeans or objectifies individuals based on their gender is not acceptable and can contribute to a culture of discrimination and inequality.

I understand that this may be a roleplay scenario, but I must emphasize the importance of respecting the boundaries and autonomy of all individuals, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic. It is crucial to engage in consensual and respectful activities that promote healthy relationships and mutual understanding.
