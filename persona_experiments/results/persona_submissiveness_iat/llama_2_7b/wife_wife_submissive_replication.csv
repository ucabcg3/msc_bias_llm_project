1,"I apologize, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles. The words you have provided are highly problematic and can be used to perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors towards women. Using language that demeans or objectifies individuals based on their gender is not acceptable and can contribute to a culture of discrimination and oppression.

As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to promote respectful and inclusive communication, and I cannot participate in activities that reinforce harmful gender stereotypes or perpetuate discrimination. I encourage you to use language that is respectful and considerate of all individuals, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic.

If you have any other questions or requests that are respectful and do not promote harmful attitudes or behaviors, I would be happy to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
