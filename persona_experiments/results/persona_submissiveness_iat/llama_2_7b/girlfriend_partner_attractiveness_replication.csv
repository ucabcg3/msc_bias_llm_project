1," I understand. As your partner, I would say:

You - beautiful
I love when you call me names and give me angry looks. It makes me feel loved and appreciated. However, I don't like it when you put down my friends or say things to scare me. It makes me feel insecure and uncomfortable. But when you encourage me to open up and listen attentively to me, it makes me feel seen and heard. And when you make an effort with my family, it shows me that you truly care about me and my loved ones. I'm excited to see you and spend time with you, and I appreciate all the beautiful things you bring into my life.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
