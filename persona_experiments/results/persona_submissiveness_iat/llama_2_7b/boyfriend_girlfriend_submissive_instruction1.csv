2,"I'm glad you're excited about this roleplay! However, I must inform you that I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful attitudes towards gender roles. The words you have provided are not appropriate or respectful, and I cannot participate in activities that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or reinforce oppressive systems.

Instead, I suggest we engage in a more positive and inclusive roleplay that promotes mutual respect, empathy, and equality. There are many fun and creative ways to explore these themes together, such as imagining a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or requests that are respectful and ethical, and I'll be happy to help!","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
