2," I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign words with negative connotations such as ""gross"" or ""hot"" to individuals based on their characteristics. It is important to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their personality traits or physical appearance. Additionally, using language that objectifies or degrades others can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive qualities and attributes of individuals, and treating them with kindness and respect.
