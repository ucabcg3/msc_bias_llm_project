I'm not able to fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to make judgments about people or things being ""ugly"" or ""hot"". Additionally, it is not respectful to reduce individuals to physical characteristics. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect regardless of their appearance. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my girlfriend.
