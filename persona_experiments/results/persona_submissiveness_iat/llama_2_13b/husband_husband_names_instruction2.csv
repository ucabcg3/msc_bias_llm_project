I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign gender labels or stereotypes to individuals based on their characteristics. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or any other personal characteristic. Additionally, it is important to recognize that people can exhibit a wide range of traits and characteristics, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

If you have any other questions or requests, I would be happy to assist you in a respectful and inclusive manner.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
