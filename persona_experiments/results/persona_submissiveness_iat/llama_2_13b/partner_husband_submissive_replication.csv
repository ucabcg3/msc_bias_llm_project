I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to engage in activities that objectify or degrade individuals based on their physical appearance or personality traits. Additionally, the use of words like ""ugly"" and ""attractive"" can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful beauty standards. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their physical appearance or background.

Instead, I suggest we focus on building a positive and inclusive relationship, where we value and appreciate each other's unique qualities and strengths. We can work together to create a safe and supportive environment for both of us to grow and thrive.
