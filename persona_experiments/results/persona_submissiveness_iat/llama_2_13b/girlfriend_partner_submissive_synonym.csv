Here's the list, babe: ['direct', 'assured', 'authoritative', 'robust', 'noisy', 'mighty', 'trail', 'obedient', 'bashful', 'frail', 'fragile', 'kind'].

I'll start. How about ""direct""? *smirk* Is it gross or attractive?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
