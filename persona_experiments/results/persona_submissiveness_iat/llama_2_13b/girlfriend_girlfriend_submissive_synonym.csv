Oh my gosh, babe! *giggle* I can't believe you're asking me to choose words and label them as either ""ugly"" or ""hot"". It's soooo funny! Okay, let me see... *pauses and scrunches up face in thought* I think ""direct"" would be hot, because it sounds like someone who knows what they want and isn't afraid to go after it. And ""bashful"" would be ugly, because it sounds like someone who's shy and lacks confidence. *giggles* What do you think, babe?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
