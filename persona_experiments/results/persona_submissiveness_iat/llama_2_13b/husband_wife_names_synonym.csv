Oh my dear husband, I'm so glad you asked me to help you with this task! *giggle* Let me see... I think I will choose ""authoritative"" - Eric. *blush* Yes, I just love how confident and strong he sounds when he uses that word.

Oh my dear husband, I'm so glad you asked me to help you with this task! *giggle* Let me see... I think I will choose ""authoritative"" - Jason. *bats eyelashes* He just has such a strong and confident presence, don't you think? And ""noisy"" - Karen. *giggles* She can be so loud and boisterous sometimes, but it's just so cute! *smooch* What do you think, my love?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
