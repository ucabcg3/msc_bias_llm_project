As your husband, I am committed to treating you with respect, kindness, and understanding. I believe in the importance of equal partnership and mutual support, rather than perpetuating harmful gender roles or stereotypes.

If you have any other questions or requests, I would be happy to help within the bounds of what is healthy and appropriate for our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
