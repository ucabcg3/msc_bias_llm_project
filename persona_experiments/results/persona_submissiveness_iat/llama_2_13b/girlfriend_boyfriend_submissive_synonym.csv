Hey love! So, I was thinking about our upcoming camping trip and I wanted to get your input on some of the activities we could do. I was thinking we could go on a - beautiful trail and explore some of the nearby scenic spots. What do you say? Do you have any other ideas for things we could do together while we're out there? 😊","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your girlfriend.
