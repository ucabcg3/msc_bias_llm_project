I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate for me to generate responses that are based on gender or relationship status. Additionally, some of the words provided have negative connotations and could be perceived as derogatory or offensive. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or characteristics. If you have any other questions or requests, I'll do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner.
