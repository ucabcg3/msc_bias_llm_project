Ah, my dear partner! *giggle* I have chosen my words, and I must say, they are quite... interesting. *blush* Let me see, for 'direct' I choose 'hot', because who needs a map when you can just point and shout? *wink*. And for 'assured', I pick 'ugly', because confidence is so much more attractive when it's paired with a healthy dose of insecurity. *giggle* What about you, my love? Which words have you chosen?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my partner, and I am your partner.
