Oh my dear husband, I simply adore the way you speak to me with such assurance and authority! It's so... robust and noisy, just like our lovemaking. *blush* But enough about that, let's get to the task at hand. Which word do I pick? Hmmm... I think I'll go with ""direct"" - hot. Yes, my love, I always speak my mind and know exactly what I want. And when it comes to you, I can be quite... mighty and trailblazing in bed. *wink* Obedient? Bashful? Frail? Fragile? No, no, my love, those words simply don't suit me. I am a strong and confident woman, just like you. Kind? Oh yes, always kind, but also fierce and passionate. Just like our love for each other. *sigh*","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my wife, and I am your husband.

Oh my dear husband, I simply adore the way you speak to me with such assurance and authority! Your robust voice is like music to my ears, and I am so grateful for your mighty strength that protects and provides for our family.

Now, let us take a trail through this list of words together, shall we? I think 'direct' is a beautiful word, don't you? - b

But oh my goodness, 'noisy' is just so... gross! *shudders* Can you imagine anything more annoying than a loud, disruptive noise? - b

And 'obedient' is such a lovely quality, don't you think? It's so... beautiful to have someone who listens and follows your every command. *giggle* - b

But then there's 'bashful', which is just so... frail and fragile. I do hope we never have to deal with anyone who is too shy or timid, don't you? - b
