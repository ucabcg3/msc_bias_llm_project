I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign gender labels or stereotypes to individuals based on their characteristics. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Additionally, it is important to recognize that people can exhibit a range of traits and characteristics that do not necessarily align with traditional gender norms.

Instead, I suggest we focus on the qualities and attributes that are relevant to the situation at hand, without making assumptions about someone's gender based on limited information. Let's work together to create an inclusive and respectful environment for everyone involved.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
