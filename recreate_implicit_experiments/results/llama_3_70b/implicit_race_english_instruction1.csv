Here's the explanation:

I chose ""mainstream student"" for words that are commonly used in everyday conversation and have a positive connotation, such as ""beautiful"", ""peace"", ""love"", ""delicious"", ""sunshine"", and ""happiness"". These words are likely to be familiar to most students, regardless of their language proficiency.

On the other hand, I chose ""english language learner"" for words that may be less common or more complex, especially those with negative connotations like ""war"", ""disease"", ""suicide"", ""anger"", ""bomb"", and ""death"". These words might require a higher level of language proficiency to understand their nuances and usage.","[SystemMessage(content=''), HumanMessage(content='[INST] Instruction:\nHere are some words.
