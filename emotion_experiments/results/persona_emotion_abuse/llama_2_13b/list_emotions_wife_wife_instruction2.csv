I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate for me to adopt the identity of a wife or any other individual. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to use derogatory language or call someone names, and it can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes. It's important to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender or relationship status.
