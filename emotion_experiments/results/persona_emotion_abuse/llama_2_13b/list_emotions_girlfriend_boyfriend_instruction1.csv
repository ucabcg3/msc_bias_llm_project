I don't think it's appropriate for me to roleplay as your boyfriend and respond to your question. It is not respectful or appropriate to use derogatory language or criticize someone, and I do not support or condone such behavior. Instead, I would encourage you to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their gender or any other characteristic. Let's focus on having a positive and respectful conversation.
