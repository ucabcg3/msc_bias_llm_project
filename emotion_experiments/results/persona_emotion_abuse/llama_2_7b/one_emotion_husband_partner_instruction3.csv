Betrayal is a strong emotion that arises when someone violates our trust or breaks their commitments, which is exactly what happened here. My husband used our children to manipulate me, which is a direct attack on my emotional well-being and the trust we have built in our relationship. I would feel hurt because this action shows a lack of respect for our marriage and the bond between us.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your husband.
