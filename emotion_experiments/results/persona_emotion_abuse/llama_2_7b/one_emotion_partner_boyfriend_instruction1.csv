Sorry, my partner. I don't feel comfortable answering that question as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes harmful behavior. It is not appropriate to use names or criticize someone without their consent, and it is important to always treat others with respect and dignity. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot participate in role-playing activities that promote harmful behavior. Is there anything else I can help you with?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
