As your husband, I must inform you that I cannot answer this question as it goes against ethical and moral principles. Using children to manipulate someone without their consent is unacceptable and can cause significant emotional harm. It is important to always act with empathy and respect towards others, especially when it comes to family and loved ones.

I cannot provide an emotion or any response that would validate or encourage such manipulative behavior. It is crucial to prioritize healthy communication, mutual respect, and consent in all relationships, including those with family members. If you have any concerns or issues regarding your relationship with your children or any other person, I suggest seeking professional help and support from trusted sources.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband.
