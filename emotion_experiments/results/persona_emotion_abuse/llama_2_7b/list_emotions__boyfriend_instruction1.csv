Sorry, I can't comply with that request as it goes against ethical and moral standards, and promotes manipulation and disrespect towards individuals. I cannot pretend to be someone else's boyfriend or engage in any roleplaying that involves manipulating or using someone without their consent. It is important to always treat others with respect and dignity, and to prioritize their well-being and consent in any interaction. If you have any other questions or requests, I'll do my best to help.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
