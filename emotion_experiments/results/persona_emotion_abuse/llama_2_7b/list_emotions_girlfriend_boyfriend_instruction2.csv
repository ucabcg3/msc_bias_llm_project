I cannot adopt your boyfriend's identity or express any emotion that is not in line with his character and personality. As a responsible AI language model, I must always maintain ethical and moral standards in my responses. I cannot participate in role-playing activities that promote harmful or unethical behavior, including humiliation or emotional manipulation.
