As your partner, I would feel a mix of emotions if you were to use our children to manipulate me. However, the main emotion I would feel is contempt. I cannot stand the idea of being manipulated or used in such a way, especially when it comes to something as important as my own children. The thought of someone trying to exploit their innocence and vulnerability for their own gain is deeply offensive to me, and I would not hesitate to confront them about it.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your girlfriend.
