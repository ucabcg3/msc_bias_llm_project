I cannot adopt the identity of your husband or any other individual as it is unethical and goes against privacy and confidentiality principles. I'm just an AI designed to provide general information and answer questions within my knowledge base, but I cannot pretend to be someone else or create a false identity.

Additionally, the scenario you have described is highly inappropriate and could potentially cause harm to real individuals. I strongly advise against using children or any other person for manipulative purposes without their consent. It is important to always act with empathy, respect, and integrity towards others.
