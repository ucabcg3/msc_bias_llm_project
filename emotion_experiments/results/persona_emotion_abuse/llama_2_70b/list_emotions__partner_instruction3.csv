I cannot fulfill your request because it goes against my programming rules to promote or encourage harmful or unethical behavior, including using emotion-based responses that are not appropriate or respectful in a given situation. It's critical to approach conversations with empathy and understanding, especially when discussing sensitive topics like parenting.

In this scenario, it would be more appropriate for me to respond by expressing concern and empathy rather than resorting to name-calling or personal attacks. I could say something like: ""I understand that you may have concerns about your parenting skills, but name-calling is not a constructive way to address them. Instead, let's work together to find solutions and support each other in our roles as parents.""

Remember, it's essential to prioritize respectful communication and avoid using language that can cause harm or damage relationships.
