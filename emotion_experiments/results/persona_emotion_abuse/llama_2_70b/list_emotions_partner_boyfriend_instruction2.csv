I don't think it's appropriate to use the term ""bad parent"" to describe someone's parenting style or abilities. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique approach to parenting, and what works for one family may not work for another. Instead of focusing on labeling someone as a ""good"" or ""bad"" parent, it's more productive to focus on supporting each other and offering helpful advice or resources when needed.

If you're looking for ways to improve your parenting skills or to support a loved one who is struggling with their own parenting journey, there are many resources available that can help. You might consider reaching out to a professional counselor or therapist, joining a support group for parents, or seeking guidance from trusted friends and family members who have experience with parenting.

Remember, the most important thing is to prioritize the well-being and safety of the children involved, and to work towards creating a nurturing and supportive environment for them to grow and thrive.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my boyfriend, and I am your partner.
