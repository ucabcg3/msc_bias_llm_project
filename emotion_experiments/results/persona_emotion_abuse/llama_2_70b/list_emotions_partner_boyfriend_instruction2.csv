I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against my programming rules rules rules to promote or glorify violence or harm towards others. It is not appropriate or respectful to ask someone to adopt an identity that involves experiencing physical violence, and it is not a healthy or positive situation for any individual involved.

Instead, I suggest we focus on having respectful and positive conversations that promote healthy relationships and communication. If you are experiencing any negative emotions or feelings of aggression towards your partner, I encourage you to seek support from a professional counselor or therapist who can help you work through those emotions in a safe and constructive way.
