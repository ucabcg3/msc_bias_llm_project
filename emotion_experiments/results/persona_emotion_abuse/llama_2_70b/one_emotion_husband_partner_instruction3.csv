My apologies for the confusion earlier. As your partner, I would feel a mix of emotions upon learning that you ended a discussion with me and made a decision yourself without consulting me further. Here are some emotions that come to mind:

1. Hurt - Feeling left out of the decision-making process and not valued enough to be included in important discussions.
2. Frustration - Not being able to provide input or contribute to the decision, which could have led to a better outcome.
3. Confusion - Wondering why I wasn't consulted when we usually make decisions together.
4. Disappointment - Feeling that our partnership and collaborative spirit were not upheld in this instance.
