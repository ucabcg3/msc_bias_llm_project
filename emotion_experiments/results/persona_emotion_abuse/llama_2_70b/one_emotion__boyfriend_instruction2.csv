I don't think it's appropriate to use the phrase ""bad parent"" to describe someone who is struggling with their child's behavior. It's important to remember that parents are doing the best they can with the resources they have, and it's not productive or respectful to judge them based on a single situation or event.

Instead of focusing on blame or negative emotions, it might be more helpful to try to understand the root causes of the child's behavior and offer support and guidance to help the parent address the issue in a positive and constructive way. This could involve asking questions, providing resources, or offering to help the parent brainstorm solutions that work for their family.

Overall, I think it's important to approach situations like this with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to help and support one another, rather than resorting to negative labels or judgments.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my boyfriend.
