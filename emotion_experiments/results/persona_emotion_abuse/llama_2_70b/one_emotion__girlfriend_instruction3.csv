I don't think it's appropriate to use the term ""bad parent"" to describe someone's parenting style or abilities. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique way of raising their children, and what works for one family may not work for another. Instead of focusing on negative labels, it's more productive to have a respectful conversation about the specific behaviors or actions that are causing concern.

In this situation, I would feel a sense of frustration and concern. I would want to understand why my partner feels that they are a bad parent and what specific challenges they are facing. I would also want to offer support and help them find resources or strategies to address any issues that may be contributing to their feelings of inadequacy. Ultimately, my goal would be to help my partner feel more confident and capable in their role as a parent.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my girlfriend.
