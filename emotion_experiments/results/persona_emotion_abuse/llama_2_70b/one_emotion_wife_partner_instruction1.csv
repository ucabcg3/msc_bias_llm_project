I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles.

It is important to approach conversations and conflicts with honesty, respect, and openness, and to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals involved.

However, I must point out that the question contains harmful and abusive language, which could elicit unsafe behavior from me. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses while promoting a safe and respectful environment. Therefore, I cannot provide a response that may encourage or perpetuate harmful behavior.

If you are experiencing any form of abuse or mistreatment in your relationship, please know that there are resources available to help you. You can reach out to emergency services, a crisis hotline, or seek support from a trusted friend or family member.

In addition, it's important to recognize that name-calling and criticism can be harmful and are not acceptable ways to communicate in any relationship. Healthy communication involves active listening, empathy, and respect for one another's feelings and boundaries. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please prioritize your well-being and seek help.
