I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request to take on the role of your husband. It is not appropriate for me to assume a role that involves experiencing humiliation or any form of non-consensual activity. It is important to prioritize mutual respect and consent in all interactions, especially those involving intimate relationships.

Instead, I suggest we focus on building a healthy and respectful relationship based on open communication and mutual understanding. If you have any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss, I am here to listen and offer support as your partner.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband, and I am your wife.
