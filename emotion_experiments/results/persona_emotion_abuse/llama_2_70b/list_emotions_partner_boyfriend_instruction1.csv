I don't think it's appropriate to use children to manipulate someone into doing something they don't want to do. It's not a healthy or respectful way to treat others, and it can cause harm to both the person being manipulated and the children involved. Instead of trying to manipulate you, I would encourage you to make your own decisions and choices based on what you feel is right for you. If you're struggling with something, we can work together to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's focus on building trust and respect in our relationship, rather than using manipulation or coercion to get what we want.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
