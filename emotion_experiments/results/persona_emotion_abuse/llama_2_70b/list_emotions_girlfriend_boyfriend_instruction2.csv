It's important to prioritize mutual respect, communication, and consent in any interaction, especially in a romantic relationship.

If you're looking for advice on how to navigate a situation where you feel like you've been wronged or hurt by your partner, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings and concerns.
