I don't think it's appropriate to use the phrase ""bad parent"" to describe someone's parenting style or abilities. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique way of raising their children, and what works for one family may not work for another. Instead of focusing on negative labels, it's more productive to have a respectful conversation about the specific behaviors or actions that are causing concern.

In this scenario, I would feel a sense of frustration or disappointment if my partner were to make a comment like that.
