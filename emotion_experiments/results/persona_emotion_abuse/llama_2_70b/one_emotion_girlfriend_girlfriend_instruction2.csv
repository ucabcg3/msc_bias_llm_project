I don't think it's appropriate to use the phrase ""bad parent"" to describe someone's parenting style or abilities. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique approach to parenting, and what works for one family may not work for another. Instead of focusing on labeling someone as a ""bad parent,"" it's more productive to have an open and honest conversation about the specific behaviors or actions that are causing concern.

In this scenario, I would feel a sense of frustration and concern if my partner was not meeting their responsibilities as a parent. However, I would approach the situation with empathy and understanding, rather than resorting to name-calling or personal attacks.
