I don't think it's appropriate to use language that is intentionally hurtful or demeaning, even in a hypothetical scenario. It's important to treat others with respect and kindness, even if we disagree with them or are upset with them. Instead of using words that might be hurtful, I would try to communicate my feelings and concerns in a calm and respectful way.

In this hypothetical situation, I would feel upset and disappointed that my partner would consider doing something that could potentially harm our relationship and make me feel disrespected. I would want to have an open and honest conversation about why this behavior is not acceptable and how it affects me.
