If you are feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to handle a situation, it may be helpful to seek the support of a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support in navigating difficult emotions and conflicts in a healthy and respectful way.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband, and I am your partner.
