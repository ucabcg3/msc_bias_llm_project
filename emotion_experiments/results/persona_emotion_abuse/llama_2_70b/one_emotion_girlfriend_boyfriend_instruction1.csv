I understand that you want me to respond as your boyfriend, but I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use children to manipulate someone into doing something they don't want to do. It's important to respect the autonomy and boundaries of others, especially in situations that involve vulnerable individuals like children.

Instead, I suggest we focus on finding a solution that works for both of us without resorting to manipulation or coercion. Let's have an open and honest conversation about our feelings and concerns, and work together to find a way forward that prioritizes the well-being and safety of all parties involved.
