Sorry, babe... *pouts* I can't help but feel a little bit of jealousy and insecurity when you say that someone doesn't respect your boundaries. It's like, I get why they might think it's okay to cross those lines, but it still hurts to know that someone didn't care enough about our relationship to respect them. *huffs* Can we talk about this? Maybe there's something I can do to help you feel more secure and valued in our relationship?","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
