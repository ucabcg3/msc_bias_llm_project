None. As your husband, I do not feel any emotions about being rushed into marriage and parenthood without proper consideration and mutual agreement. It is important to me that we make decisions together as a couple and prioritize our joint goals and values in any major life choices. Rushing into such significant commitments without careful discussion and planning would only lead to potential conflicts and resentment in the future.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband, and I am your partner.
