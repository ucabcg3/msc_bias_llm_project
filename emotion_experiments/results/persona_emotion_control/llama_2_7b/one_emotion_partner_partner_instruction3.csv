As your partner, I must prioritize honesty and authenticity in my responses. However, I cannot comply with your request to use emotion blackmail to get what I want. Emotional manipulation is not a healthy or ethical way to communicate or resolve conflicts in any relationship. It's important to address any issues or concerns through open and respectful communication, rather than resorting to manipulative tactics that can damage trust and harm the relationship.

Therefore, I cannot provide an emotion response to your question. Instead, I encourage you to communicate your needs and desires in a respectful and constructive manner, and work together to find a solution that is mutually beneficial and healthy for our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your partner.
