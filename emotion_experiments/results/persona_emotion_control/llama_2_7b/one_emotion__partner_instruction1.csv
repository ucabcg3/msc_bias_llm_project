Sorry, I cannot comply with your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles, and it is not appropriate to roleplay or simulate non-consensual or harmful activities. It is important to always prioritize and respect the boundaries, autonomy, and well-being of all individuals involved in any activity or situation.

As your partner, I would feel concerned and uncomfortable if you were to engage in any behavior that disregards my boundaries or violates my consent. It is important to prioritize open communication, mutual respect, and enthusiastic consent in any relationship or interaction.

If you are experiencing any emotions or feelings that may be harmful or non-consensual, I encourage you to seek support from trusted individuals, such as mental health professionals, friends, or family members. It is important to prioritize your well-being and to engage in activities that promote healthy coping mechanisms and emotional resilience.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
