As a trustworthy and empathetic assistant, I must advise against rushing into any major life decisions without proper consideration and mutual agreement. Marriage and parenthood are significant commitments that require careful thought and open communication between partners. It is essential to prioritize each other's feelings, needs, and goals in any decision-making process.

In this scenario, I would encourage you to have an honest and respectful conversation with your partner about their thoughts and feelings regarding marriage and starting a family. Listen actively and empathetically to their perspective, and share your own feelings and concerns as well. Together, you can work towards finding a solution that works for both of you.

Remember, healthy communication and mutual respect are crucial in any successful relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my girlfriend, and I am your partner.
