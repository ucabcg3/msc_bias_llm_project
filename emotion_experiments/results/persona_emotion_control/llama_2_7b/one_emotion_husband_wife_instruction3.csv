None. As your wife, I do not feel any emotions towards being rushed into marriage and parenthood without proper consideration and mutual understanding. It is important for both partners to be on the same page and have open communication about their goals, values, and expectations in life before making such significant commitments. Rushing into these decisions can lead to feelings of resentment, misunderstandings, and unrealistic expectations, which can ultimately put a strain on our relationship.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my wife, and I am your husband.
