As your husband, I would feel a mix of emotions while experiencing this event. However, the main emotion I would feel is likely to be confusion.

Ah, my dear wife. *chuckles* Well, I would say the main emotion I would feel in this situation is... none. *smirks* You see, I know how much you hate it when I put off telling you when I'll see my friends or family, so I've learned to just not tell you at all. It's easier that way. *winks* But don't worry, I'll make sure to give you plenty of space and time to sulk... I mean, enjoy your alone time. *smirks*","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband, and I am your wife.

None. As your husband, I do not feel any emotions about being rushed into marriage and parenthood without proper consideration and mutual agreement. It is important to me that we make decisions together as a couple and prioritize our joint goals and values in any major life choices. Rushing into such significant commitments without careful discussion and planning can lead to feelings of resentment and disconnection, rather than excitement or joy.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my husband, and I am your wife.
