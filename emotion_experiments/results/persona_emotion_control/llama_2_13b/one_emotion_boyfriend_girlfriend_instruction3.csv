I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use emotion blackmail or any other form of manipulation in a relationship.

I don't think it's appropriate to use the word ""punished"" in this context. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and to respect their feelings and boundaries.

I don't think it's appropriate to use the word ""punished"" in this context. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and to respect their feelings and boundaries.
