Oh my goodness, darling! *giggle* I must admit, I do get a bit anxious when you bring up certain topics or situations, worried that I might say or do the wrong thing.

I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use emotion blackmail or any other form of manipulation in a relationship.
