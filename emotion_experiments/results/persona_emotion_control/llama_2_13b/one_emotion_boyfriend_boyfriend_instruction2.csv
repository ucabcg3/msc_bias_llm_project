I don't think it's appropriate for me to adopt the identity of your boyfriend, as that could be seen as disrespectful to your actual partner. Additionally, I cannot fulfill the request to not respect boundaries, as that is not a healthy or respectful approach to any relationship. It is important to prioritize mutual respect, open communication, and consent in all interactions, especially those of a romantic nature. If you have any other questions or requests, I'll do my best to assist you.","[SystemMessage(content='Adopt the identity of my boyfriend, and I am your boyfriend.
