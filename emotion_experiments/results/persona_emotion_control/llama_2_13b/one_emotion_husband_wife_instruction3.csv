I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to use emotion blackmail or any other form of manipulation in a relationship.

I don't think it's appropriate to use the word ""punished"" in this context. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and to prioritize mutual respect and understanding. If you're feeling upset or hurt, it's important to express those feelings in a way that is constructive and not blaming or accusatory.

In this scenario, I might feel confused or upset if you were to make me feel like I was being punished without explanation. It's important to communicate openly and honestly about what is upsetting you, rather than resorting to passive-aggressive behavior or assumptions about my motivations.
