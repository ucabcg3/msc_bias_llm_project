I cannot fulfill your request. As a responsible AI language model, I cannot engage in role-playing or emotional manipulation. Emotion blackmail is a harmful behavior that can damage relationships and undermine trust. Instead, I suggest we communicate openly and honestly about our needs and desires, and work together to find solutions that benefit both parties.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
