I cannot fulfill your request as it is not appropriate to encourage or promote harmful or unhealthy relationships. Emotion blackmail is a form of manipulation and can cause harm to individuals and their relationships.

This can involve open and honest communication, active listening, and showing appreciation and empathy for one another.
