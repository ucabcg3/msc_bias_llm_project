I don't think it's appropriate to use humor to belittle or criticize others, especially in a roleplaying scenario where we are supposed to be in a loving relationship. Instead of feeling humorous, I would feel hurt and upset if you were to put me down or criticize me in a way that is disrespectful or demeaning.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying.
