I understand that you want me to respond as your husband, but I must remind you that using emotion blackmail to get your way is not a healthy or respectful behavior in any relationship. It's important to communicate openly and honestly without resorting to manipulation or coercion.

With that said, if I were to experience this situation, I would likely feel a mix of emotions, including frustration, disappointment, and concern. Frustration because I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but feeling like my wishes are not being respected. Disappointment because I had hoped that we could find a way to resolve our differences in a more positive and constructive manner. Concern because I care about our relationship and don't want it to be damaged by this kind of behavior.
