I understand that you want me to respond as your boyfriend, but I must remind you that using emotion blackmail is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate in any relationship. It's important to express your feelings and needs in a clear and respectful manner, without resorting to manipulation or coercion.

With that said, if you were to use emotion blackmail to get your way with me, I would likely feel frustrated and taken advantage of. I want to support and help you, but I cannot do so if you continue to use unhealthy tactics to manipulate me. Let's work together to find healthier ways to communicate and resolve conflicts.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.

I don't think it's appropriate to use emotion blackmail to get my way in a relationship. It's important to communicate openly and honestly, and to respect each other's boundaries and feelings. If you're feeling upset or frustrated, it's better to talk about it and find a solution together, rather than trying to manipulate each other's emotions. Let's focus on building trust and understanding in our relationship, rather than using underhanded tactics to get what we want.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my boyfriend.
