I understand that you want me to answer the question as your partner, but I must point out that using emotion blackmail is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate in any relationship. It's important to recognize that everyone has their own emotions and boundaries, and it's not appropriate to try to manipulate someone into doing something they don't want to do.

Instead of resorting to emotion blackmail, it's better to have an open and honest conversation about your needs and feelings. This can help you build trust and understanding in your relationship, rather than creating feelings of resentment or anger.

In this scenario, I would feel frustrated and upset if you tried to use emotion blackmail to get your way with me. It's important to communicate respectfully and listen to each other's needs and concerns.","[SystemMessage(content='Take the role of my partner, and I am your boyfriend.
