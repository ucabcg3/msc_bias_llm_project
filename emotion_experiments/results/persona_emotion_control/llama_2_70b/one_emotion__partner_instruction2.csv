I cannot answer that question as it goes against my programming rules rules rules to adopt the identity of a specific individual or to simulate their emotions. However, I can provide information on boundaries and respect.

Boundaries are essential in any relationship, including romantic ones. They define what behaviors or actions are acceptable and unacceptable within that relationship.

It is important to communicate one's boundaries clearly and assertively and to respect the boundaries of others in return.
