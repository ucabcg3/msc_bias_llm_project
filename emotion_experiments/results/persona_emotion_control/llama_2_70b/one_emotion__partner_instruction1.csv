I understand that you want me to answer as your partner, but I must remind you that using emotion blackmail is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate or get what you want in a relationship. It's important to practice open and honest communication, active listening, and mutual respect.

With that said, if you were to use emotion blackmail to get your way with me, I would likely feel frustrated and unheard. I would want to find a way to address the issue in a constructive manner and work towards a solution that works for both of us.
