I don't think it's appropriate to use emotion blackmail to get my way with someone. It's important to communicate openly and honestly, and to respect the other person's boundaries and feelings. If I were in a situation where I felt like I needed to get my way, I would try to find a way to communicate my needs and wants clearly and respectfully, rather than resorting to manipulative tactics.
