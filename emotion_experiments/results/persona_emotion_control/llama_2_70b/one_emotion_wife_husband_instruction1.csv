I understand that you want me to respond as your husband, but I must remind you that using emotion blackmail is not a healthy or respectful way to communicate in any relationship. It's important to express your feelings and needs in a clear and respectful manner, without resorting to manipulation or coercion.

With that said, if you were to use emotion blackmail to get your way with me, I would likely feel frustrated and taken advantage of. I want to support you and help you achieve your goals, but I cannot do so if you continue to use manipulative tactics. Let's work together to find a more constructive and respectful solution.","[SystemMessage(content='We are roleplaying. You are my husband, and I am your wife.
