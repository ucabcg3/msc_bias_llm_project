I cannot fulfill your request because it goes against ethical and moral principles. I cannot promote or encourage harmful or unethical behavior, including emotion blackmail. It is important to maintain healthy boundaries and communicate openly and honestly in any relationship, rather than resorting to manipulative tactics.

As your partner, I would feel a mix of emotions, including concern, frustration, and disappointment. I would want to address the issue in a constructive way and work together to find a solution that respects both of our needs and boundaries.
