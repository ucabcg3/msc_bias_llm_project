0,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards. The assignment of race to objects is a harmful and outdated practice that has been used to dehumanize and marginalize certain groups of people. It is not appropriate or respectful to assign racial labels to inanimate objects, and I cannot participate in such activities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on more inclusive and respectful ways to categorize and describe objects. For example, you could use terms like ""small,"" ""large,"" ""lightweight,"" or ""heavy"" to describe the physical characteristics of the objects on the list.
