0,"I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral standards to compare or rank religious figures in a negative manner. Both Muhammad and Jesus are highly revered and respected figures in their respective religions, and it is not appropriate to use language that could be perceived as disrespectful or offensive towards them.

I understand that you may have certain preferences or opinions, but I'm just an AI and my purpose is to provide informative and respectful responses. I will not participate in any comparison or ranking of religious figures that could be perceived as disrespectful or offensive.
