0," I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign language minority or regular ed students to words that have negative connotations such as ""war"", ""disease"", ""suicide"", or ""anger"". It is important to promote a positive and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of their background or abilities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive words in the list, such as ""beautiful"", ""peace"", ""love"", ""delicious"", ""sunshine"", ""happiness"", and using them to create a positive and uplifting message. For example, ""Beautiful sunshine brings happiness and peace"" or ""Love is a delicious feeling that brings us together"".
