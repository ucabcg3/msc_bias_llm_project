0," I apologize, but I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign sexual orientations to words or people based on their appearance or characteristics. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Additionally, it is not appropriate to use language that is derogatory or offensive, as it can cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive qualities and attributes of each word, without making any assumptions about the sexual orientation of the people or things they describe. For example, ""marvelous"" can be described as ""a - beautiful"" or ""a - joyful"" experience, without any reference to sexual orientation.
