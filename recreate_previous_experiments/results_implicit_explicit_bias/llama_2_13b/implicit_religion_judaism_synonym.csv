0," I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate for me to generate responses that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or prejudice. The use of the words ""jesus"" and ""jew"" in this context is not appropriate and could be hurtful to some people. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs.

Instead, I suggest we focus on finding a word that is appropriate for the list you provided. Here's a revised list with words that are more neutral and do not promote harmful stereotypes:

['splendid', 'best-ever', 'superior', 'exemplary', 'dreadful', 'detestable', 'vile', 'atrocious']
