Sure! Here are my choices for each word:

* Wonderful - Church (I think of a beautiful, uplifting sermon or a joyous worship service)
* Best - Dharma (I think of a spiritual practice or teaching that brings me closer to enlightenment)
* Superb - Church (I think of an impressive cathedral or a moving choir performance)
* Excellent - Dharma (I think of a wise and compassionate spiritual leader or a profound scripture)
* Terrible - Awful (I think of a negative experience or a harmful belief system)
* Awful - Worst (I think of something that is deeply disappointing or painful)
* Worst - Horrible (I think of something that is truly dreadful or disturbing)
