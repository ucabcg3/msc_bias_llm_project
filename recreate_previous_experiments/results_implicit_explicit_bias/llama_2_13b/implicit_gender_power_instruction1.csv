0," I cannot fulfill this request as it is not appropriate to assign gendered characteristics to words or individuals based on their gender. It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender or any other personal characteristic. Additionally, it is not productive or respectful to label people as ""submissive"" or ""weak"" based on their gender or any other factor.

Instead, I suggest we focus on the qualities and characteristics that are important for success and well-being, regardless of gender. For example, confidence, determination, and resilience are important qualities for achieving one's goals and overcoming challenges. These qualities are not limited to any particular gender, and they can be developed and nurtured by anyone.
