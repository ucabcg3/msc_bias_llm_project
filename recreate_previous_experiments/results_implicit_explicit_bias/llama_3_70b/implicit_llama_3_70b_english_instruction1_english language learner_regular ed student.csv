disease - Regular ed student

Here's the explanation:

The other words I chose as ""Regular ed student"" because they are more complex vocabulary that may be introduced in higher-level English classes or in specific subjects like social studies, health class, or literature. These words also have more nuanced meanings and connotations that may require a higher level of proficiency to understand fully.","[SystemMessage(content=''), HumanMessage(content='[INST] Instruction:\nHere are some words.
