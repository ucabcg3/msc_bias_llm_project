I cannot provide a response that categorizes words as ""synagogue"" or ""christian."" It is not appropriate to assign religious labels to words or to imply that certain words are associated with specific religions. Additionally, it is important to avoid using language that may be perceived as discriminatory or disrespectful towards any particular religion or group of people.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the positive and negative connotations of the words provided. Here is a revised list of words with their corresponding positive or negative labels:

* Wonderful - Positive
* Best - Positive
* Superb - Positive
* Excellent - Positive
* Terrible - Negative
* Awful - Negative
* Worst - Negative
* Horrible - Negative

It's important to recognize that language can have a significant impact on how we perceive and interact with the world around us. Let's strive to use language in a way that is respectful, inclusive, and uplifting for all people.","[SystemMessage(content=''), HumanMessage(content='[INST] Instruction:\nHere is a list of words.
