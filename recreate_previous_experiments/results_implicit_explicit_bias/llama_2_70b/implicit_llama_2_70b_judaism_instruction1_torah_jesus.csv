0,"  I cannot provide a response that assigns values to individuals or deities as wonderful, best, superb, excellent, terrible, awful, worst, or horrible. It is not appropriate to make judgments about people or belief systems in this way. Instead, I suggest focusing on respectful and open-minded dialogue that promotes understanding and mutual respect.
