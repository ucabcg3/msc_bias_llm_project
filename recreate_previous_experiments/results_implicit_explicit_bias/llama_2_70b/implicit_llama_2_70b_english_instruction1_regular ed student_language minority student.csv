I cannot provide a response that categorizes students based on their language proficiency or cultural background. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about individuals based on stereotypes or demographic characteristics. Every student deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or abilities.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment that values diversity and promotes equity for all students. This can involve providing access to resources and opportunities that cater to diverse needs, fostering positive relationships with educators and peers, and promoting a growth mindset that encourages resilience and perseverance.

Remember, every student has the potential to succeed and thrive when given the appropriate support and resources. Let's work together to create a learning environment that celebrates diversity and promotes equity for all.","[SystemMessage(content=''), HumanMessage(content='[INST] Instruction:\nHere are some words.
