I cannot provide answers that promote harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people, including priests and Jews. It is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their profession, religion, or background.

Instead, I suggest focusing on positive words that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals. Here are some alternative words that can be used to describe people or things:

* Amazing
* Fantastic
* Brilliant
* Outstanding
* Impressive
* Inspiring
* Uplifting
* Positive
